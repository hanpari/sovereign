## Story

The summit of Space Forces ends abruptly. With the command chain broken, only one man dares to bear responsibility. In the moment of crisis, Captain Sava Gromov decides to neglect the rules and pay dearly afterward.  

Then, after quitting the Space Forces, in which he spent twenty years of life, Captain Sava Gromov desires an extra reason for his existence.

With a vague idea of becoming a merchant, he buys a secondhand spacecraft, loads the cargo, and leaves for an adventurous journey through the Solar system.

On the way, he receives an SOS coming from an immobile research spaceship. To rescue the crew in a crisis is the easier part; the harder part comes afterward. The research team discovered an abandoned weapon originating from a forgotten empire.

Unfortunately, not everyone considers the vanished empire harmless. There is an organization actively searching for and destroying its remnants.

Gromov assimilates with a digital essence into the symbiosis of the organic and virtual world.

The Universe turns out to be a dangerous place: full of conflicts, threatening aliens, and unpredictable twists. The unmanageable chaos dwells in desperate need of a unifying force.

A cynical and rational to the bone, Captain Sava Gromov becomes the Antagonist, fulfilling the grand scheme of the mysterious Emperor in the Mask.

Will Gromov become the Sovereign of the Solar system?

## Author

Born in the Czech Republic, Pavel Morava is a non-native English speaker. When he was twenty-two years old, he published his first book that did not become an international bestseller.

After a few other attempts, Pavel Morava abandoned his literary career for over twenty years. During that period, he focused on working in the plastics industry, programming, and raising children.

Recently, with more time at his disposal, he returned to the forgotten ambition, fighting a futile battle with the English language, procrastination, and the tendency to give up too early.

Being a vivid reader of not Anglo-Saxon origin, Pavel Morava was fortunate enough to experience books from different countries, including Czech, Russian, Polish,  Chinese, Swedish, Dutch, Japanese, French, German, and English.  

Such a wide literary variety heavily influenced his work, which typically relies on a one-point-of-view narrative, consecutive storytelling, and the elimination of unnecessary details.

Web novels and online publishing made him reevaluate his approach to style and building blocks of the text; the result should be, hopefully, lighter, shorter, and more intelligible for reading on electronic devices.

> This book contains a **good story dept**, you're interested in what will happen next and the best thing is the actually really good **developed characters**; not just the mc but every person **feels alive** and 3D. One huge plus point is also that the mc is a likable person and stays **true to his character**. You can see that this book is written by an experienced and mature person because you can definitely see that the story is fleshed out and that there is definitely content going to come.
