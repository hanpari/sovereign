# Meet Our Lord

Despite a warm welcome, the Paradise base adopted inconspicuous caution when they had been dealing with the incoming freight ship.

A careful observer would not miss armed men, always loitering around any member of Gromov's crew. But the initial wariness wore out quickly. Complaining bitterly to her diary about Gromov's inaction, Simone was enjoying the attention of young Angels, dating them with the zealotry of an adolescent girl, held for too long in the cage of involuntary celibacy.

Disappointed, Hawk found out that his pipe dreams about having the woman vanished in the furious competition. The Paradise base was a mining facility with a very unbalanced ratio between the two sexes; the harsh working conditions preferred males, so Simone had immediately become an idol of lonely hearts who were deprived of erotic interactions for years.

Even Zhutra, released from the harmful influence of Simone's whisperings, revived his lost interest in gender studies, and with the insolency of someone who had never been to asteroid mines, inquired about the shocking sexism that prevent females to participate in such an unthankful and dangerous endeavor.

To Gromov's sheer amusement, no matter how often Zhutra had encountered the miners' reassurance, he would refute the very idea that it was not the malevolent intention of male miners, but rather the unwillingness of women to embark on the journey, full of uncertainly, hard work, and painful deaths.

After several heated debates with Khamal Zhutra, no one believed in his secret identity as a military analyst anymore. Yet, a few jovial miners, probably out of boredom, followed Zhutra's lead and founded an organization called  Establishment of Gender Equality in Mines. Only its venerable chairman did not understand the sorry fact that he had ended up among pranksters and that no other member of EGEM took his holy crusade seriously.

"The place here is a chauvinistic jungle," confessed Zhutra to Gromov, "but these chaps, even though gems in rough to speak mildly, have the potential to evolve. I'm thinking of staying with them for a while. I contacted the University about the matter and Dean Mobama was very enthusiastic. In her opinion, my return would be premature, given my great opportunity to spread our values among 'savages'."

"Sounds like you'll become a missionary," grunted Gromov, who stood in front of a mirror and had Doll polish his appearance. He was readying himself to meet the chief of the Paradise base, the very man Hawk and Ali had called Our Lord. "So your dean is not very fond of having you back, isn't she?"

Zhutra was about to deny the claim, but with surprising honesty, he admitted: "She hinted that the situation was not in my favor. However, the University stands behind me, even though there have been some unpleasant investigations going on. Thankfully, the authority in charge showed an unexpected level of empathy."

"Unexpected level of empathy?"

Gromov had met investigators of space disasters before, so he knew that these officials exercised an "unexpected level of empathy" only if some influential lobby intended to sweep the incident under the rug. However, even with the utmost respect to Professor Zhutra's academic achievements, the man was literary nobody with no significant backers.

Thus, the only plausible culprit behind the scene remained the DOZOR. But why they would let Zhutra stay on the Paradise base instead of pressing Dean Mobama to have Zhutra come back with his possible findings?

Seemingly uninterested in further conversation, Gromov meticulously inspected his reflection in the mirror.

"Doll, what do you think of this black necktie? Isn't it a bit formal? I usually wear it at funerals."

With a light smile, Doll rearranged the shirt collar and chirped: "The black tie is a nefarious omen, Captain Gromov, so we should not underestimate its symbolism. A funeral may come sooner than later."

"I concur. We better be prepared."

After Doll had discreetly confirmed his suspicion, Gromov bid farewell to confused Zhutra and left the room.

The renewed activities of Free Traders suggested that DOZOR had not given up on their support. If the Paradise base was Free Traders' next target, DOZOR had a more convenient way of how to deal with the professor and their missing agent.

Since Simone had failed her mission, DOZOR must have realized she was no longer trustworthy. So, the organization dispatched Free Traders to take care of both, hiding two deaths in the usual ruthless mayhem.

As Doll had implied, the hostile action would occur rather sooner than later, preferably before the freight ship left Paradise. After all, the base was easier to target than a moving object with an undisclosed location.

"Big G, this way."

Hawk, still sullying over his unfulfilled love affair, was appointed to be Gromov's escort.
