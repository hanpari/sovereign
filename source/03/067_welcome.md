# Welcome

The endless journey was over.  No matter how convinient and comfortable the Luciano's spaceship was, the loneliness of vast space had been getting on nerves of Gromov and his companions.

The visual contact with a huge asteroid and the base located on and below its surface felt like a gush of fresh air.
Especially Professor Zhutra celebrated with the fervor of a prisoner nearing the end of his sentence.

"I made it," he repeated with tears in his eyes. "Simone, we made it. The moment we are on the ground, we can pay them to send us home."

Even Gromov had not the heart to mock him. Over the passing time while nonstop solving mathematical exercises, the poor man became a wretch. His black curly hair turned grey, the figure of dwarfish Adonis lost a gread deal of muscles, and his pale complexion only remotely evoked the neatly dressed beau he once used to be.

Even his behaviour had adjusted, and the alpha-male movements were replaced by almost autistic shyness and timidness.

"Algebra surely works wonders," pondered Gromov with satisfaction.

Countless personal trainers offered courses on how to become more assertive and self-confident, but only Simone managed to completely destroy a man with pure mathematics.

Gone was the arrogant know-it-all, always ready to call out everyone with his human-right stick. 

Today's Zhutra learned to appreciate calm solitude of a humble ignorant  in the world of undescribable complexity.

Over weeks, Gromov could observe the altered activities in Zhutra's cerebral  lobes, fascinated by the process. It was akin to watch a popular video in which an ugly yet surprisingly intelligent octopus overcame an prearranged obstacle.

Everytime Zhutra was about to give up, Simone stepped in and talked him into dragging the carriage of abstract problems farther and farther.

"Eager to leave us so soon, Khamal?" Gromov spoke up. "Simone and I are so proud of your progress. We enjoy your company."

"Thank you, Sava. But I can't overstay my welcome. You have your business to run, and I have my duties as a professor. My students await my return."

"Have you thought of parents?"

"Parents? What parents?"

"I mean the parents of your deceased assistents. Three girls are dead. Their parents might be slightly unhappy about the fact. Although I admire your willingness to face consequences, someone less valiant would be reluctant to meet them. Moreover, the spaceship under your command has been destroyed. I wonder whether the University will write it off easily. Both of them may press charges on you."

"Charges? Why?"

To Gromov's astonishment, the possibility of being held responsible for his ship's catastrophe had never occured to Zhutra. At least one would judge so from his sincere surprise.

"Khamal, my dearest aquintance, don't tell me you  have never thought of that? The everlasting gloomy face of yours - I was under impression that the unbearable guilt eats you alive."

"Unbearable guilt? Sava, such accidents do happen, don't they? Who would blame me?"

"Who? Parents, the University, and the police come on mind."

"I am innocent."

"Yes, the famous last line of all convicts."

"But I followed the proper procedures. I can prove as much. My consciousness is clear."

"Sure, sure," sighed Gromov. "I was talking just hypothetically. I don't doubt that after your return to your academic career, everything will be absolutely fine. The deacon will offer you words of condolences and the disturbed parents will accept their losses with stoic indifference. Which reminds me of Xenophon and his reaction to the death of his son. All parents are aware of the obvious fact their children have been born mortal."

[Pavel Morava's remark: The Greek philosopher Xenophon accepted the death of his son with these words.]

"What are you trying to say, Sava?"

"Nothing, nothing. Take it easy, Khamal. Do not mind my tactless excursion into the ancient history."

Khamal processed the information. "You seem to hint at something. Please, be frank with me, Sava. Is there any chance, no matter how unlikely, that I might go in prison?"

"Perhaps," sneered Gromov.

"So you think that coming back is not the safest idea?"

"I would call it a brave and manly decision. After all, another three or five years spent in seclusion may get your mathematical skills to unprecedent levels. You may even get more useful diploma than the one you got from gender studies."

"Aha!"

The realization that his trouble would not end after he left Gromov's presense put Zhutra's mind into disarray.

"So what should I do?"

"My honest opinion?"

"Of course! Of course! You would never lie to me. You are a direct man, Sava. Don't spare me."
"As you wish. Doll, be so kind and enlighten our guest."

The motionless android opened her magnificent blue eyes and pointed finger at the computer screen.

"I've prepared all available data, Professor Zhutra. The compilation has been sent to your account. But as Captain Gromov guessed the odds are against you. In almost 2123 similar cases, the spaceship captains were apprehended, a half of them fined and a quarter imprisoned. The maximum sentence was twenty years, but you, Professor Zhutra, may serve about three-year sentence."

"Three years!"

Meanwhile, Simone started to pay attention to the conversation and gesticulate to Gromov silent yet distint message: "Stop it right now!"

"Oh, wait!" Doll exclaimed suddenly. "I have found a intriguing positive correlation between the length of sentence and the social status of victims."

"Positive correlation? What is it?"

Gromov ignored Simone and chuckled: "Khamal, be sure to learn some statistics as well. I reckon that Doll stepped on well-known bias against us poor bastards. Were your assistents of rich families?"

"Rich families? Does it make any difference?"
"In theoretical realm of blind justice not, but in practice, the lady with folded eyes seems to care more about our wealthier peers. Shameful, isn't it? If your PhD students were dirty poor, you would have nothing to fear."

Khamal gulped: "I'm afraid that I wouldn't call them dirty poor. Not that I prefer students with money, Sava, certainly not, but it appears that they emerged from rather well-established families. Our University is never biased against poor students per se, but for obvious reasons, we had a great deal of middleclass and upperclass graduates. After all, we depend on sponsorships and fees to cover our cost."

"Good for you. I mean good for the institution. But for your person, the students from a ghetto would present lesser legislative liason. No one cares for socially excluded, right?"

"That's rather cynical point of view."

"The correlation won't disappear just because you dismiss it as cynical, Khamal. You better prepare yourself for the worst."

With that Parthian shot, Gromov left the room, whistling cheerfully. Fuming Simone followed.

"May I know," she fired the moment they were in a safe distance, "what were you doing? Why did you scare Khamal? Have you forgotten the plan?" 

"No."

"The coward won't come back now."

"And?"

"We need to part our ways. DOZOR must go after him."

"So you do believe that Khamal will keep us company?"

"What else?" barked Simone. "He's the most selfish worm under the sun. For months, I was making sure not to mention these legal implications to him. And for what? For you to ruin my whispering a few hours before the end?"

"Calm down!"

"I wish I could. I thought we had an agreement. You've never objected the plan and you are smart enough to understand what it takes."

"Calm down, Simone!"
