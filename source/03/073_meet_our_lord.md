# Meet Our Lord

Never before had Gromov met such a gargantuan obelisk. Overgrown in every possible dimension, the man called Our Lord sat in a large armchair of special construction. Rather than a solid matter, he had the liquidity of a cat as the enormous gulfs of fat filled all available cavities, giving him a square-shaped constitution of a brick.

It was hard to tell what sort of clothes the man was wearing, but if Gromov had to guess, he would take the bag of blue and grey stripes for a pajama, perhaps several of them sawn together, yet still unable to embrace the true size of the giant.

A complete albino, the body hair of that man seemed non-existent or unrecognizable. So at first impression, Gromov thought Our Lord was bald - and blind at that as the eyelids located in the area where a normal human would have organs of sight appeared glued together.

"Welcome to my humble office, Captain Gromov."

The voice coming out of the hole below something with a remote resemblance to a nose reverberated throughout the room.

"Thank you, sir."

Stoned to the core, Gromov kept standing by the closed door, without a sign of moving in.

It was not only the whale that shocked him. There was art on the wall, too. From corner to a corner, the oil painting in distinct Luciano's style dominated the view of the flabbergasted visitor.

Watching the bucolic scene, splattered with pink and azure strokes, Gromov judged that the masterpiece had to be inspired by Boticelli on drugs.

In the epicenter of the pastel eruption, Our Lord was depicted in his naked glory, comfortably laid on a fluffy cloud, chastely covering the treasures of his crotch with his left hand while his right hand was picking up grapes out of a silver plate.

The silver plate and the rest of the fiest were served by pinkish nude angels of round shapes bordering with unhealthy obesity. This time, Luciano decided to adjust female torsos to the oversized protagonist, so a random passerby would only wonder how exactly those angels were supposed to fly, being equiped with such tiny featherly wings.

"Luciano did paint this one!"

Our Lord pleased by Gromov's astonishment announced the name as if mentioning an artist, broadly recognized by kunsthistorians all over the Solar System.

"I was posing ten days naked," Our Lord added proudly. "What do you think of it, Captain Gromov."

"It is mo-monumental!"

The first moment Gromov was tempted to say monstrous. Having been dumped by Samara again, he felt aggrieved and wanted to hurt someone. On the other side, after being exposed for months to Luciano's art, Gromov had developed certain curiosity for Luciano artistic means.

As Simone had correctly observed, Luciano was talented for an amateur. But since he mostly used Doll for a reference, the question was how he had dealt with the inflated limbs of the heavy-weighted angels. The answer was that Luciano had not.

In the detailed inspection, those angels metamorphosed into stuffy pink ballons with white protrusions on their back, so rather than women they ressembled flying do-nuts.

"Did it pique your interest, Captain Gromov? Trust me I saw this reaction often."

"Take care of it, sir. One day Luciano may become famous."

Our Lord nodded majestaticaly. "So kind of you. Luciano was apprehensive about his painting skills. He regretted he'd never received formal education."

"It doesn't matter. Luciano has what it takes to become popular."

As Gromov did not appreciate contemporary art, he ment that Luciano was mediocre enough to be sought after by any modern gallery. "But enough of our little cultural discoursion," he said instead. "How should I address you, sir? I'm a bit reluctant to call you Our Lord."

Our Lord's lips moved uppwards.

"Why not?" he objected. "My name's is Peter Saint. Nomen Omen, right? As a a keeper of Pearly Gates, I'm predestined to be called this way."

"Why not," agreed Gromov, "except for the fact that Christians don't call Saint Peter Their Lord. This would promoted a mere apostle into god-ranks. But more importantly, your name isn't Peter Saint. Did you forget you'd been baptized Peter Swaschbuckler?"

It was hard to tell whether the revelation shocked the man as he stayed motionless. But then he spoke up in a less warm voice: "Where did you learn the name, Captain Gromov?"

Gromov did not respond.

"You criminal record is nothing short of impressive," he continued instead. "A convicted felon, a prison escapee, two murder attempts, a mercenery and at last, not the least an ex-Free Trader. Bravo!"

"I was never a member of Free Traders," declared Peter Swaschbuckler, not bothering to deny the rest. "You should update your files. And there were no murder attempts. I never intented to kill those policemen."

"Oh, I beg your pardon. Of course, you've not been part of Free Traders. You only keep supplying them with goods. Nothing personal. May I know as why they want to attack your Paradise out of the blue? Arent they your bussiness partners?"

After a while, Peter Swaschbuckler heaved a sigh. "Before we continue, may I know what is the position of Space Forces in this situation?"

"This has nothing to do with Space Forces."

"Of course, how silly of me!" grunted Peter Swaschbuckler. "I forgot you were a mere space merchant on a bussiness trip, Captain Gromov. A dishonored hero on his new mission."

"Exactly,"
