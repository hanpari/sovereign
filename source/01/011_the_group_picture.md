The evening program, including the concert of Miriam B, turned out to be enjoyable. The singer had a powerful, cultivated voice, much richer than Gromov expected. From the intimate slow songs to culminating hits with a rock arrangement, she offered her repertoire with confidence, not restricted by the stage's small size.

Despite her name, which one would associate with the teen audience, she was already reaching forty; she masked the age under layers of shiny golden makeup.

Being short, she utilized enormously high heels to appear taller, dancing on her tiptoes. Her white silk dress sparkled with glitters all over the voluptuous body, exposing well-developed breasts in the deep cleavage.

When the show was over, Gromov clapped enthusiastically, feeling a slight pity for abandoned and hungry Akane. Together with Schubert and his friends from the local military base, they talked about the last events in war development, observing frantic preparations near the stage where the photographer was readying platform for a group photo of the singer with pilots.

Mrs. Annabelle Corbin, now looking much healthier when not dealing with Gromov, organized the whole session in a clear, penetrating voice, audible all over the room.

"No, no, sugar, this is how things work here. I told you we have enough men; now we need female pilots. This photo has to be gender-balanced. No is no, stop your mansplaining, please. Just be so kind and find me your female colleagues if you want to help. Hey, everyone, we need beautiful ladies over here!"

Outraged pilots left, shaking their heads, disappointed she banned them from shooting the photos.

Mrs. Corbin got offended and complained to Major Sholto, who seemed more and more exhausted - his benevolent brown eyes almost hidden by drooping eyelids.

"Did you see that?" crowed Mrs. Corbin. "They're gone. I asked them politely to help and what they did? Just run away. What's wrong with the guys today, major? I'm not poisoning the well, but they are just entitled arrogant assholes. Where are all that girls? According to my list, we should have a surplus of them. Jasmine Soria is missing. Where is Jasmine? Jasmine, come here."

"Unfortunately, she died in action last week. They sent Captain Chi instead."

"Poor thing. We cannot wait until they'll revive her, though. Is Captain Chi a woman?"

"No, he was with the other pilots."

"Typical. They replaced the woman with a man, trying to undermine the position of our gender."

"They had no other choice, I believe. We asked them to pick up senior pilots only."

"Excuses, major. They have to try harder next time. Not holding young talented women back. Who is the next on my list? Anbi Akane. Lieutenant Anbi! She should be here. Where is she?"

"Not sure. Sergeant Jerzinski reported to me she had gotten into the fight before."

"Oh, say no more. A man attacked her, didn't he?"

Major Sholto shrugged: "Frankly, Jerzinski's was not clear on that. From what I understood, nothing serious happened. You can ask her superior or Lieutenant Schubert over there. The latter was involved somehow."

"I hope that sweet thing wasn't bruised beyond repair. Where is the brute? I need to talk to him."

Gromov, who could not stop laughing, covered his face in the palms and whispered to astonished Schubert. "That nice lady is after you, pal. Mansplain yourself properly."
