“What was the problem with my boys, anyway?” Sergeant asked, waving the hand towards two cadets. They waited there silently.

“Their blasters are unlocked. I can see them glowing green.”

“What? Why would they do that? Hey you, is it true?”

“Yes, sir. We were told to be on high alert. The procedure requires…”

Sergeant looked astonished. “What procedure?”

Andrey was struggling to understand what his underlings were talking.

“Being on high alert in a battle situation,” explained Gromov.  “They put safety off, ready to open fire. I don’t need to ask who ordered this nonsense in the civilian city, do I? However, Steiner should not appreciate if they blow their legs away or maim an innocent bystander. “

Andrey rolled his eyes. “That’s about right. You guys put safety on. We don’t want to have some nasty accident. Remember, you are mere decoration. Just puff your chests and keep smiling. In case of sudden attack, fire wildly into the air.”

“Is there any chance for Plantarians to come?” Akane inquired curiously. “I thought this area belonged to a safety zone, with a low probability of being hit.”

“Hush, Lieutenant,” said Andrey. “What a sheer blasphemy! Colonel likes to think we defend the frontier. We have to await space cockroaches with eyes open, uniform donned, and song on our lips. We haven’t received any enemy warning for the last two years, though.”

“Really? Sounds comfortable.”

“Oh, it is. This SF summit is our biggest opportunity to shine. Colonel boasts he got permission to draw the best pilots over here. All of them might clap their hands as soon as he receives his promotion. Ah, sorry, that’s classified information. Officially, you attend because higher-ups appreciate your diligence and bravery.”

“Reckless,” mumbled Gromov. “Plantarians might’ve ceased their activities recently, but who knows whether they pull something out of their sleeve.”

“Mushrooms have no sleeves,” Andrey shrugged. “Each base sent two representatives mostly. It won’t harm their defense. Well, unless you count the one above us.”

“Why?”

“Seventy percent of personnel were allowed to enjoy themselves. Of course, they ought to be on a high alert. I bet they get drunk by midnight, if not sooner. You know Colonel fancies having a good company around.”

“Seventy percent? Is it sabotage or what?”

“Don’t worry; we’ve obtained special permission from the minister. Colonel personally guaranteed that nothing stressful will happen during the summit.”

“He’s got an excellent intel.”

“Hahaha, you bet. Just between us,” Jerzinsky started to whisper. “From a good source, I’ve got info that mushrooms regrouped their forces. Nobody knows why they’ve disappeared. One guy told me he expected them to strike at an unusual target position. For instance, a certain military base with low activity.”

“You’re kidding me!”

“You wish. Colonel’s retarded, died five times, and became completely nuts.”

Andrey began stuttering, trying to persuade them. 

He died three time when ordered to go suicidal, which was the tactic of last resort under Q-Field impact. From distorted point of view, commonly adopted in Space Forces, they shall hail Sergeant Jerzinski for the ultimate display of bravery. Perhaps he was missing the glorious old times as well.

Pilots and gunners, including technical personnel, glorified such deaths like the badge of honor. From Gromov’s perspective, red number on the sleeve could hardly justified the loss of memory and slight mental retardation.

“The sky is open for an ambush, then?” he asked.

“Not exactly,” admitted Andrey. “Right now, two cruiser-class spaceships are relocating to provide us the area protection.”

“That’s unsatisfactory,” said Gromov.
