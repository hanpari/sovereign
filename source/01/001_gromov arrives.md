# Gromov přichází

Před vysokou budovu, postavenou ze skleněných a hliníkových panelů, hotelu Belgrava přijel taxík. Kolem budovy stály rozložitelné zátarasy a mezi nimi procházely vojenské hlídky.  

Z auta vystoupily dva lidé, muž a žena. Oba dva byly oblečeni do modrých uniform, které napovídaly, že jde o piloty Vesmírných sil. Muž měl na výložkách čtyři kapitánské trojúhelníky, zatímco žena pouze jeden.

Z bezděčných doteků a pozornosti, které podporučice svým výložkám věnovala, se dalo soudit, že ji povýšili nedávno. Své okolí si prohlížela s patřičným potěšením, zjevně hrdá na to, kde se nachází.

"Konečně," vykřikla. "Zasloužený luxus!"

Muž, který měl potíže se dostat z mělého vozu, se napřímil a protáhl si ztuhlé svaly.

"Jistě," odpověděl a rozhlížel se vyloženě znechuceně. "Zase našli další způsob jak plýtvat penězi. Jen se podívejme na ty roztomilé kadety s nabitými a odjištěnými blastry. Přesně ten druh bezpečí, který potřebujeme v civilním městě. Hej, vy tam! Pojďte sem!"

Hlídka dvou kadetů v namodralých uniformách zaváhala. Nakonec se ale neodvážila vzdorovat autoritě, s jakou si je kapitán předvolal.

"Pane?"

"Taková otázka, hrdinové. Kdo vám dovolil odjistit vaše zatracené zbraně? Ještě k tomu na veřejnosti?"

"Hlídkujeme, pane."

"Jistě, a nepřítel číhá tamhle v křoví. Chcete si odstřelit nohu - nebo hůř? Zajistěte to a přestaňte blbnout."

"Promiňte, pane. Ve vší úctě, vy nám nemůžete dávat rozkazy."

"Výborně. V tom případě mi zavolejte toho, kdo to tady má na starost. Rád si s ním nebo s ní popovídám."

Jeden z kadetů stiskl komunikační náramek a chvíli do něj hovořil. Žena zatahala kapitána netrpělivě za rukáv a zašeptala: "Ale prosím, Savo. Zkazíš veškerou legraci, když se budeš chovat jako pito-" 

Tady se zarazila, nejspíš aby se vyhnula slovu, které postrádalo patřičnou úctu k nadřízenému. Mezi nim byl rozdíl nejméně deseti let, nemluvě o rozdílu v jejich osobnostech. Se svýma mandlovýma očima, něžnými rysy, a krátkým vojenským sestřihem, žena působila jako veselé a hravé kotě, kdežto kapitán se zdál být její pravým opakem - mužem, se kterým si není radno zahrávat.

Having strict green eyes narrowed in constant disapproval, the captain's demeanor possessed an air of natural dignity and importance. He was used to giving orders, so young cadets who opposed him were rather praiseworthy.

After a couple of minutes, a sergeant appeared. He was a bulky, shortish man with a bald head and clean-shaved wrinkled face. Once he came out of the hotel entrance, he checked out the situation. When he spotted the officer's distinction, he started saluting; then, he stopped and offered a handshake instead.

"Sava Gromov! It's you!"

After seeing casualness like this, both cadets were taken aback as they probably did not expect the sergeant to act this way. Even the lieutenant glared unpleasantly at him. She either kept her superior in high esteem or didn't approve of familiarity coming from lower ranks.

However, Gromov did not mind.

"Andrey Jerzinski," he said heartily and shook the hand. "It's been a while. Now I can understand why it is so messed up. You are in charge."

"The hell I am. Address all your complaints to Colonel Steiner, your best fan. Not a day passed without him complaining about your performance. I don't get why he bothered to invite you. As for me, I was lucky to avoid you for five long years. I should've realized you caused the uproar here. Never satisfied with anything, aren't you, Sava the Troublemaker?"

"Exactly so."

Then, Gromov turned toward his astonished companion. “Akane, meet my old friend, Sergeant Andrey Jerzinski. He'd served at our base before you came. Andrey, this is Lieutenant Anbi Akane, the worst pilot I had the honor to serve with."

The sergeant shook the female hand with a wry smile: "Don't mind him. He is no ace either."

Confused, Akane accepted the greetings: "You should not speak of him so lightly."

"Oh, I should. I have to. Just listening to that devil may undermine all your self-respect. I guess he hasn't brought you here for no reason."

"She is a pretty face," snorted Gromov. “The craziest imbecile under my command.”

"Your manners have gotten even worse," frowned Andrey. "You can't treat a beautiful lady like this, Sava."

Akane blushed and pointed at the red number under the left shoulder.

"He can't forgive me that I had died in action. We got into a rough ordeal, and I didn't follow his orders. Not that I remember anything."

"Killed in action, huh?"

The sergeant showed the red digit on his uniform. "All my three under Sava as a wing commander. I don't blame him, though. It was doing of that idiot Steiner. This glory-seeking moron thinks the more we die, the better soldiers we are. After the third one, I could not take it anymore. Sava helped me to transfer here. A safe place if you ask me. "

"Was it bad?" 

"Absolutely. With each death, it has become worse. Not remembering names and friends, I had problems with proper reasoning. I couldn't even recognize my old mother. They needed to introduce me to her, for God's sake."

"Sorry to hear that."

"Oh, spare us, Andrey," interjected Gromov. "You left home when you were thirteen if I recall correctly. No wonder you didn't recognize her."

"Hey, I'm trying to win some sympathy here. Never mind. I was never the brightest."

The sergeant said his line with a cheerful expression, and Gromov shook his head pitifully. He did not enjoy the way he was speaking to his old friend. Three backups in the row took a significant toll on Andrey. 

The recovering technology was said to damage about ten percent of the original personality, but Gromov believed the result affected more than just a memory.


After the series of revivals, Andrey gradually turned into a far cry from the man he used to be. It was kinder to pretend there were no visible changes than to confirm his level of mental deterioration to him.

Gromov knew that Andrey had to be on pills that stimulated his brain; without drugs, the ghola's brain synapses stayed weaker with every iteration.

[Pavel Morava's remark: The term "ghola" was used in Frank Herbert's Dune to describe a clone with memories of the original person.]


"What was the problem with my boys, anyway?" Sergeant asked, waving the hand toward two cadets. They waited there silently.

"Their blasters are unlocked. I can see them glowing green."

"What? Why would they do that? Hey you, is it true?"

"Yes, sir. We were told to be on high alert. The procedure requires…"

The sergeant looked astonished. "What procedure?"

Andrey was struggling to understand what his underlings were talking about.

"Being on high alert in a battle situation," explained Gromov. "They put safety off, ready to open fire. I don't need to ask who ordered this nonsense in the civilian city, do I? However, Steiner should not appreciate if they blow their legs away or maim an innocent bystander. "

Andrey rolled his eyes. "That's about right. You guys put the safety on. We don't want to have some nasty accident. Remember, you are mere decoration. Just puff your chests and keep smiling. In case of sudden attack, keep firing wildly into the air."

"Is there any chance for Plantarians to come?" Akane inquired curiously. "I thought this area belonged to a safety zone, with a low probability of being hit."

"Hush, Lieutenant," said Andrey. "What a sheer blasphemy! Colonel likes to think we defend the frontier. We have to await space cockroaches with eyes open, uniforms donned, and song on our lips. We haven't received any enemy warning for the last two years, though."

"Really? Sounds comfortable."

"Oh, it is. This SF summit is our biggest opportunity to shine. Colonel boasts he got permission to draw the best pilots over here. All of them might clap their hands as soon as he receives his promotion. Ah, sorry, that's classified information. Officially, you attend because higher-ups appreciate your diligence and bravery."

"Reckless," mumbled Gromov. "Plantarians might've ceased their activities recently, but who knows whether they pull something out of their sleeve."

"Mushrooms have no sleeves," Andrey shrugged. "Each base sent two representatives mostly. It won't harm their defense. Well, unless you count the one above us."

"Why?"

"Seventy percent of personnel were allowed to enjoy themselves. Of course, they ought to be on a high alert. I bet they get drunk by midnight, if not sooner. You know Colonel fancies having a good company around."

"Seventy percent? Is it sabotage or what?"

"Don't worry; we've obtained special permission from the minister. Colonel personally guaranteed that nothing stressful will happen during the summit."

"He's got an excellent intel."

"Hahaha, you bet. Just between us," Jerzinsky started to whisper. "From a good source, I've got info that mushrooms regrouped their forces. Nobody knows why they've disappeared. One guy told me he expected them to strike at an unusual target position. For instance, a certain military base with low activity."

"You're kidding me!"

"You wish. Colonel's retarded, died five times, and became completely nuts."

Andrey began stuttering, trying to persuade them. 

He died three times when ordered to go suicidal, which was the tactic of last resort under Q-Field impact. From a distorted point of view, commonly adopted in Space Forces, they shall hail Sergeant Jerzinski for the ultimate display of bravery. Perhaps he was missing the glorious old times as well.

Pilots and gunners, including technical personnel, glorified such deaths as a badge of honor. From Gromov's perspective, the red number on the sleeve could hardly justify the loss of memory and slight mental retardation.

"The sky is open for an ambush, then?" he asked.

"Not exactly," admitted Andrey. "Right now, two cruiser-class spaceships are relocating to provide us the area protection."

"That's unsatisfactory," said Gromov.
