# Gromov arrives

The taxi car arrived in front of hotel Belgrava, a tall building composed of glass and aluminum panels.

Detachable plates, labeled as a Space Forces property, fenced the hotel while military patrols were walking by, guarding the opening.

From the car, two persons emerged, a man and a woman. Both of them wore blue uniforms, indicating they belonged to Space Forces pilots; the man sported captain distinction, the four golden stars, while the women have only one of them.

From the manner she was unconsciously touching her shoulders, one would deduce her promotion had occurred recently. She watched her surroundings with vivid expression, obviously enjoying herself.

“Finally,” she exclaimed. “The well-deserved luxury awaits!”

The man, who had trouble getting out from the tiny car, straightened up and performed some exercise to relieve his sore back.

“Sure,” he replied and observed security measurements with apparent disdain. “They found another way how to waste money. Just look at those cadets with fully charged and unlocked blasters. How adorable! This is exactly the safety we need to have in the middle of the city. Hey you! Come over here!”

The patrol of two young soldiers in bluish uniform hesitated for a moment; then, the authority, with which the captain called them, gave them no other choice.

“Sir?”

“Just a question, cadets. Who permitted unlocking your bloody weapons in public?”

“We are patrolling, sir.”

“With the enemy nearby, I guess. Do you want to blow your legs away? Just lock it up and don’t mess around.”

“Excuse me, sir. With all respect, but you are in no position to give us orders.”

“Is that so? In that case, be so kind and call the person in charge. I’d like to have a word with him or her.”

The cadet pressed his communication wristband and talked to it. Impatiently, the female lieutenant pulled the sleeve of the captain’s uniform and whispered: “Oh come on, don’t be like this, Sava. You ruin all fun being such a j…”

She stopped, reluctant to continue as the word she intended to use lacked proper respect. Between them, a gap of ten years was plain, not to speak the differences in personalities. With her almond-shaped big brown eyes, soft features, and short haircut, she was radiating an impression of a cheerful, easy-going cute kitten, while the captain seemed to be her true opposite, a man who does not like to joke around.

Having strict green eyes narrowed in constant disapproval, the captain’s demeanor possessed an air of natural dignity and importance. He was used to giving orders, so young cadets who opposed him were rather praiseworthy.
