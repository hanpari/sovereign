# Andrey Jerzinski meets Gromov

After a couple of minutes, a sergeant appeared. He was a bulky, shortish man with a bald head and clean shaved wrinkled face. As he came out of the hotel entrance, he checked out the situation. When he spotted the officer's distinction, he started saluting; then, he stopped and offered a handshake instead.

"Sava Gromov! It's you!"

After seeing casualness like this, both cadets were taken aback as they probably did not expect the sergeant to act this way. Even the lieutenant glared unpleasantly at him. She either kept her superior in high esteem or didn't approve of familiarity coming from lower ranks.

However, Gromov did not mind.

"Andrey Jerzinski," he said heartily and shook the hand. "It's been a while. Now I can understand why it is so messed up. You are in charge."

"The hell I am. Address all your complaints to Colonel Steiner, your best fan. Not a day passed without him complaining about your performance. I don't get why he bothered to invite you. As for me, I was lucky to avoid you for five long years. I should've realized you caused the uproar here. Never satisfied with anything, aren't you, Sava the Troublemaker?"

"Exactly so."

Then, Gromov turned toward his astonished companion. “Akane, meet my old friend, Sergeant Andrey Jerzinski. He'd served at our base before you came. Andrey, this is Lieutenant Anbi Akane, the worst pilot I had the honor to serve with."
The sergeant shook the female hand with a wry smile: "Don't mind him. He is no ace either."

Confused, Akane accepted the greetings: "You should not speak of him so lightly."

"Oh, I should. I have to. Just listening to that devil may undermine all your self-respect. I guess he hasn't brought you here for no reason."

"She is a pretty face," snorted Gromov. “The craziest imbecile under my command.”

"Your manners have gotten even worse," frowned Andrey. "You can't treat a beautiful lady like this, Sava."

Akane blushed and pointed at the red number under the left shoulder.

"He can't forgive me that I had died in action. We got into a rough ordeal, and I didn't follow his orders. Not that I remember anything."

"Killed in action, huh?"

The sergeant showed the red digit on his uniform. "All my three under Sava as a wing commander. I don't blame him, though. It was doing of that idiot Steiner. This glory-seeking moron thinks the more we die, the better soldiers we are. After the third one, I could not take it anymore. Sava helped me to transfer here. A safe place if you ask me. "

"Was it bad?" 

"Absolutely. With each death, it has become worse. Not remembering names, friends, I had problems with proper reasoning. I couldn't even recognize my old mother. They needed to introduce me to her, for God's sake."

"Sorry to hear that."

"Oh, spare us, Andrey," interjected Gromov. "You left home when you were thirteen, if I recall correctly. No wonder you didn't recognize her."

"Hey, I'm trying to win some sympathy here. Never mind. I was never the brightest."

The sergeant said his line with a cheerful expression, and Gromov shook his head pitifully. He did not enjoy the way he was speaking to his old friend. Three backups in the row took a significant toll on Andrey. 

The recovering technology was said to damage about ten percent of the original personality, but Gromov believed the result affected more than just a memory.


After the series of revivals, Andrey gradually turned into a far cry of man he used to be. It was kinder to pretend there were no visible changes than confirming the level of mental deterioration to him.

Gromov knew that Andrey had to be on pills that stimulated his brain; without drugs, the ghola's brain synapses stayed weaker with every iteration.

[Pavel Morava's remark: The term "ghola" was used in Frank Herbert's Dune to describe a clone with memories of the original person.]
