The aftermath turned into a surrealistic painting. Akane, the main culprit, kept repeating that the whole accident was not her fault, whereas Heinrich Schubert, the innocent victim, apologized several times.


 Confused Andrey Jerzinski and Military Police questioned Gromov, unable to comprehend, what was his role. They had to think he was the attacker and they concluded that all witnesses were covering the captain up.


It took about half an hour to explain everything.


When Akane unapologetically clarified why she hit Schubert, Andrey Jerzinski grinned and showed her thumbs up.


In the end, they decided to put Akane to home detention, meaning she was about to stay in the hotel room until the summit is over.


"What?" she shouted, baffled. "Wait, you can't do that. Miriam B is singing tonight. Lieutenant Schubert already told you, guys, what happened. Not my fault you see."


One of MP turned to Gromov: "I'm sorry, captain. She started the ordeal. I hope you understand."


It sounded like asking for permission.


"I take all responsibility," proclaimed Schubert. "She was right to punch me."


Are you a masochist or what, thought Gromov. From his perspective, MPs should take Akane away, send Schubert to the infirmary, and close the case. They were too benevolent.


"I'll escort Lieutenant Anbi to her room," he said finally. "You have my word she won't leave it. Do you agree, gentlemen?"
 

"Certainly, captain," the MPs saluted in obvious relief. "Thank you for cooperation, sir."


Embarrassed, Gromov grabbed protesting Akane and led her away. Pilots scattered away, only Heinrich Schubert followed them to the hotel lift.
In silence, they came into the room.


"Come on Sava, I've told you already it was not my fault. You know that Steiner guy. You could let him handle things."


"Shut up," growled Gromov. "Both of you."


Schubert just opened the mouth, probably to burst into another long batch of self-criticism.


Gromov particularly enjoyed how the young Lieutenant offered suicide as the insufficient amendment for insulting the noble war hero. Suppressing the urge to point at the window and command him to jump, Gromov sighed heavily.


"In your best interest, stop judging people by their sleeves. I am not mad at you. I should apologize instead."


"I don't deserve such kind words, sir. I caused trouble for you and Lieutenant Anbi."


"Why is that? I still don't get what trouble you caused. My subordinate smashed your face. I hope she didn't break your nose."


"The inadequate punishment for my idiocy, sir."


"You've heard him, Sava. I don't deserve being treated like this."


Gromov stared at her until she stopped complaining.


"As far as I am concerned, you screwed up things magnificently. Stay quiet unless being told otherwise. As for you, Lieutenant, use the bathroom and wash your face from blood. I presume you have no spare shirt?"


"No, sir."


"As expected. Akane, give him yours. You are about the same size and rank."


"What? I have no spare one, either. And tomorrow, we are leaving."


"It is unnecessary, sir," protested Schubert. "I'll manage somehow."


"I do insist," said Gromov. "Lieutenant Anbi will have a lot of time at her disposal tonight. She can contemplate her wrongdoing while cleaning your shirt."


"Ok," agreed Akane. She realized the captain was serious. Without further hesitation, she started undoing the buttons. Schubert wanted to turn away in embarrassment.


"Don't be so shy," she giggled. "Never seen a girl naked?"


"But..."


With the small breasts, she was rather boyish and undeveloped. Still, Schubert blushed and reverted to the room wall. Unfortunately, the tall mirror was hanged there, so his only choice was to close the eyes.


To sheer Gromov amusement, Schubert failed to do so and continued observing the slender female figure.
