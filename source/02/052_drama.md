"Should I marry Peter?"

On his third vacation day, Samara contacted Gromov, and invited him to a small, comfy coffee. They were drinking vine while Gromov sourly desired something stronger. He knew the talk would be a disaster, but he could not help himself.

Samara wore a casual costume, giving away vibes of sucessful bussiness woman, while her smiles were charming hearts of men, no matter their age or status.

"Of course, you should marry Peter," Gromov replied nonchalantely. "He is handsome, nice, and smart. I wonder what makes you think you shouldn't. Nota bene, when you have already been engaged for a couple of months. By the way, do you mind me having, how do you call that, an aperitive? Hey, waiter, bring me double vodka, please."

"The same here!"

Samara pushed her vine away and watched him attentively. She had green, fox-like eyes with small wrinkles in corners, gentle nose, and lips with lipstick too red to Gromov's taste.

"Sava," she said. "Jerzinski had talked to me. He hinted you wouldn't be happy once you learn about Peter's proposal."

Samara always addressed Andrey by his surname. Originally, Gromov thought she did not like Andrey and tried to keep a distance from him since he was a noisy and unpolished "diamond in raw". But even so, she always insisted on meeting the both of them, treating Andrey like an old friend, sometimes almost making Gromov jealous. She acted more detached during the rare opportunities when she and Gromov were alone.  

"Peter is a fine fellow, my favorite buddy. Certainly better than certain chatter-box. I see no reason why I should not be happy."

"If I am not mistaken, I met you two about a year ago," Samara sighed and put her slender hand on his. "Two brave soldiers who wanted to shoot my dog."

"It was not your dog. And Andrey did not shoot it."

"A pity because I would not mind. My aunt's dog is an ugly, pitiful creature."

Gromov was clearly remembering this very encounter.

In the late spring days, he and Andrey used to play chess in the park, drinking from a bottle that Andrey labeled as METHANOL FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.

After his second backup in a row, Andrey was under observation period, daily visiting the near hospital and out of duty. His mental state suffered heavily because the detoriation caused by the backup became more prominent.

Their games of chess were less balanced, and Andrey complained that evaluating five moves ahead made his head hurt - which had never been an issue before. Due to his internal struggle with growing migraine, he tended to get irritated over small things.

Suddenly, he stood up with an angry expression and said to someone behind Gromov's back: "Hey beauty, the dog of yours seems to be my compatriot in pain. Do you mind if I kill it to shorten its suffering?"

When Gromov turned around, he spotted dark-haired lady with green eyes, thin lips, and well-defined cheekbones, clad in a black skirt and snow-white shirt, who wore a jacket over her forearm.

On a long leash, she was walking a grayish French bulldog. Wheezing, coughing, and breathing hardly, the animal bravely treaded the gravel path, with huge eyes almost popping out of shallow sockets. Every day in flat-faced dog's life had to be a constant purgatory.

The woman appeared taken aback for a while, evaluating both men and their SF uniforms. Finally as she came to a conclusion they do not pose any threat, she stopped and retorted calmly: "I do not mind at all, dear sir. Make a short work with this pitiful creature as you wish. But once you do that, please be sure to collect his dead body and accompany me back to my aunt who believes that the dog is the only pleasure of her existence."

With slightly curved lips, she approached Andrey and inspected his uniform: "Sergeant Jerzinski, is it?"

"That's right, madame. At your full disposal."

Since Andrey did not waver either, Gromov considered the option of jumping out and bursting into apologies. On the other hand, he thought, why should I be sorry for that moron?

The staring contest between Andrey and the young lady took about one long minute, during which Gromov experienced amusement and emberrasement simultanously.

Sardonically, the woman continued: "Since you are so fond of mercy killing, Sergeant Jerzinski, I wonder if you can do me a favor."

"With pleasure. Do you own more abused animals that need an extermination?"

"Sort of. As I said before, the dog belongs to my auntie, who is terminally ill. I am afraid that the very moment she realizes that the doggie left her side forever, she may get a bit upset. This will result likely into prolonged agony that should not left you undisturbed, given how caring human you appear to be. My request is simple. Come with me and send the doggie and my poor aunt on their last journey together."

"Only this?" Andrey sneered. "Have you an preferable order of how to perform these executions?"

"Most certainly," the woman nodded in satisfaction. "If you do not mind, my auntie first. From perpective of humanity, she should depart with her beloved pet in arms, quitting the world without necessary pain and sadness. I hope you can manage this selfish request of mine, sergeant."

After the exchange, Gromov wished he could have become invisible. However, Andrey calmly packed up the chessboard, put chesspieces into the case, and gestured towards her.

"Lead the way, milady. Nobody can blame SF officers for abandoning their duty. May I introduce you my colleague to you? This is Captain Gromov. I can imagine that seeing the foregoing scene (hopefully not too gory) may negatively affect your psyche, so you may want to seek a safe haven in his manly disposition."
