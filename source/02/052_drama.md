# Drama

Infuriated, as nobody likes to be taken for a fool, Gromov headed to Luciano's closet, from where he took a wooden box, full of brushes, dirty rags, and oil paints.

Unceremoniously, he threw the accesories away, satisfied with exquisite looks of his loot.

"They say one takes no possesion to the other side," Gromov laughed maniacally, returning to his cabin. "But one can always try ... Oh, crap!"

When the brushes were been cast out of the box, they fought back, and one sharp ink pen had stabbed Gromov's palm.

He was in the middle of arranging the proprietes for the ongoing drama when he realized the dripping blood had stained the mysterious egg, which he carefully situated in the treasure chest.

"Oh mighty ghost of this ship, you won again!" Gromov shouted, smearing the blood over the smooth surface. "But the brave endure!"

Right now, the cabin was a complete mess. Doll's pink handcuffs were laying on the table while the chair was covered by Gromov's finest and only suit, the one he used to attend funerals of his fellow soldiers.

Gromov disliked the suit. Not because of those funerals, but because it reminded him of Samara's wedding: the bittersweet memory he wanted to bury deep down. Still, the day reappeared again.

With a sudden dizziness, Gromov collapsed, losing all the motivation to continue. "Isn't it stupid? Childish?"

Sleepy and weary, he started to dig the graveyard of the past, forced into an unexpected and unwelcomed introspection ...

"Should I marry Peter?"

On the third day of his vacation, Samara contacted Gromov and invited him to a small, comfy coffee. They were drinking vine while Gromov sourly desired something more substantial. He knew the talk would be a disaster, but he could not help himself.

Samara wore a casual costume, giving away vibes of a successful businesswoman, while her smiles were charming hearts of men, no matter their age.

Gromov was no exception, dwelling in never-admitted desire for the last three months.

"Of course, you should marry Peter," he replied nonchalantly. "He is handsome, nice, and smart. I wonder what makes you think you shouldn't. Nota bene, when you have already been engaged for a couple of months. By the way, do you mind me having, how do you call that, an aperitive? Hey, waiter, bring me double vodka, please."

"The same here!"

Samara pushed her vine away and observed him. She had green, fox-like eyes with small wrinkles in corners, a gentle nose, and lips with lipstick too red to Gromov's taste.

"Sava," she said. "Jerzinski had talked to me. He hinted you wouldn't be happy once you learn about Peter's proposal."

Samara always addressed Andrey by his surname. Originally, Gromov thought she did not like Andrey and tried to keep a distance from him since he was a noisy and unpolished "diamond in raw". But even so, she always insisted on meeting the both of them, treating Andrey like an old friend, sometimes almost making Gromov jealous. She acted more detached during the rare opportunities when she and Gromov were alone.  

"Peter is a fine fellow, my favorite buddy," Gromov insisted lightly. He did not lie, though. In his opinion, Peter Grasov possessed qualities a woman should appreciate in a man: reliable, successful, handsome, and kind-hearted. Compared to Peter, Gromov felt unworthy. "I see no reason why I should not be happy."

Samara stayed silent for a while.

"If I am not mistaken, I met you two about a year ago," she sighed and put her slender hand on his. "Two brave soldiers who wanted to shoot my dog."

"It was not your dog. And Andrey did not shoot it."

"A pity because I would not mind. My aunt's dog is an ugly, pitiful creature."

Gromov remembered this very encounter. Then, a strange thing happened. The stage had changed. The cozy coffee transformed into another place.

"Hello? Who? It's you ... No, no problem. The park near the hospital ... OK, bye."

Gromov saw Andrey picking up his cellphone, talking to someone in a hushed voice.

In the late spring days, they used to play chess in the park, drinking from a bottle labeled as METHANOL FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.

After his second backup in a row, Andrey was under observation period, daily visiting the nearby hospital and out of duty. His mental state suffered because the deterioration caused by the backup became more prominent.

With their chess game less balanced, Andrey complained that evaluating five moves ahead made his head hurt - which had never been an issue before. Due to his internal struggle with growing migraines, he tended to get irritated over small things.

Before his inevitable defeat, he stood up with an angry expression and said to someone behind Gromov's back: "Hey beauty, the dog of yours seems to be my compatriot in pain. Do you mind if I kill it to shorten its suffering?"

When Gromov turned around, he spotted a dark-haired lady with green eyes, thin lips, and well-defined cheekbones, clad in a black skirt and snow-white shirt, who wore a jacket over her forearm.

On a long leash, she was walking a grayish French bulldog. Wheezing and coughing, the animal bravely trod the gravel path, with huge eyes almost popping out of shallow sockets. Every day in the flat-faced dog's life had to be a constant purgatory.

The woman appeared taken aback for a while, evaluating both men and their SF uniforms. Finally, as she came to a conclusion they do not pose any threat, she stopped and retorted calmly: "I do not mind at all, dear sir. Make a short work with this pitiful creature of mine. But once you do that, please be sure to collect his dead body and accompany me back to my aunt, who believes that the dog is the only pleasure of her existence."

With slightly curved lips, she approached Andrey and inspected his uniform: "Sergeant Jerzinski, is it?"

"That's right, madame. At your full disposal."

Since Andrey did not waver either, Gromov considered the option of jumping out and bursting into apologies. On the other hand, he thought, why should I be sorry for that moron?

The staring contest between Andrey and the young lady took about one long minute, during which Gromov experienced amusement and embarrassment simultaneously.

Sardonically, the woman continued: "Since you are so fond of mercy killing, Sergeant Jerzinski, I wonder if you can do me a favor."

"With pleasure. Do you own more abused animals that need extermination?"

"Sort of. As I said before, the dog belongs to my auntie, who is terminally ill. I am afraid that the very moment she realizes that the doggie left her side forever, she may get a bit upset. This will likely result in prolonged agony that should not leave you undisturbed, given how caring human you appear to be. My request is simple. Come with me and send the doggie and my poor aunt on their last journey together."

"Only this?" Andrey sneered. "Have you a preferable order of how to perform these executions?"

"Most certainly," the woman nodded in satisfaction. "If you do not mind, my auntie first. She should depart with her beloved pet in arms, quitting the world without necessary pain and sadness. I hope you can manage this selfish request of mine, sergeant."

"No problem."

After the exchange, Gromov wished he could have disappeared. However, Andrey calmly packed up the chessboard, put chess pieces into the case, and gestured towards her.

"Lead the way, milady," he said. "Nobody can blame SF officers for abandoning their duty. May I introduce my colleague to you? This is Captain Gromov. I can imagine that seeing the upcoming scene will negatively affect your psyche, so you may want to seek a safe haven in his manly disposition."

Gromov made himself smaller. "I am a completely unrelated party."

At least, he wanted to clarify as much. But the moment she came closer and examined him carefully, the same way she had done it with Andrey, he got captivated by her looks.

"So pleased to meet you, captain."

The offered hand had sensitive, slender fingers with long nails. From shoes to a pearl necklace, she emanated an air of cultivated, fashion-aware woman, situated in the upper class. But she lacked the predatory aura often found (at least in Gromov's opinion) among wealthy people.

Even though he did not intend to get involved in Andrey's mess, he hardly resisted the attraction caused by her natural charm.

"Nice to meet you," he answered indifferently, too stiff to smile back.

"Are you a pilot?"

"Right now, I feel more like a warden of a mental asylum," replied Gromov, angrily staring at Andrey. "Please, do excuse him. My friend lives through harsh difficulties, so he deems himself entitled to unforgivable rudeness. But rest assured, we are both harmless."

"Is it so?" She got closer to him and whispered. "With regards to national security, I wonder if I should not be petrified if an SF officer admitted he was harmless. Aren't you suppose to be, you know, dangerous or threatening? Like a hyena?"

Hyena? Why hyena?

Gromov did not remember Samara ever talking about hyenas. Moreover, the scene he happened to be in felt somewhat unrealistic. Where the coffee went? Why was Andrey alive? Am I dying while clips of my life wander before my eyes?

But he did not mind. There were two people he ever cared about. He obediently followed the suit, inquiring about Samara's circumstances.

"I am a new kid on the block," she chatted jovially. "My auntie left me to walk her dog to get acquainted with new people. She explicitly said that men who care about animals could not be bad. Furthermore, she explained to me I should contact SF officers if I get into trouble. She is sooo fond of SF officers. My uncle was one of them. I am pretty sure she will be very happy to meet you before ..."

She made a quick cutting movement around her neck.

"This..."

Uncomfortable to the bones, Gromov could not get rid of the impression she was doing it on purpose. Meanwhile, Andrey, walking few steps behind, wore a cruel expression of a serial killer.

About ten minutes later, they stooped at an ornamental gate of a villa located in an expensive neighborhood. Samara invited them inside and led their party into the exquisite hall where an old lady sat on a wheelchair, accompanied by a nurse.

"Auntie, I'm home," Samara said and kissed the lady on the forehead. "These gentlemen agreed to help us with the small problem of yours."

"Oh, so nice of them," the lady greeted them enthusiastically. "My hubby always told me that the SF officers were the best. Samara has no friends here, and frankly, I would never expect anyone to take care of me at a moment's notice. Splendid! I begged the company to come as soon as possible, but they decided to neglect my worsening conditions altogether."

"The company?"

Gromov wondered if she was referring to some shady business involved in euthanasia. Suddenly, he spotted how Andrey was rolling up his sleeves.

"Do you want to make it here?" Andrey asked grimly.

The old lady patted his hand thankfully.

"That would be lovely, sergeant," she chirped. "Currently, I am not able to move elsewhere. It is so cumbersome that I prefer to stay downstairs. I had to ask Samara to walk my sweetheart because I was stuck in the lounge. A quite disturbing situation, I'm afraid. But with you here, I'm sure that all my trouble will vanish at once."

"Count on us!"

To Gromov's horror, Andrey came closer and observed the lady from all possible angles.

"No problem," he said to Samara afterward. "Can I have some tools? Do you know where your aunt stores knives? Paper towels can be handy as well. It may be dirty work."

Samara nodded and brought a toolbox, from which Andrey took out a huge hammer.

"What are you going to do?"

Gromov could not take it anymore. After approaching Andrey, he took the hammer from his hands. "Seriously, even in your current state, you should know better."

"Oh, should I?" Andrey grinned. "So, will your majesty repair the bloody wheelchair? Because I saw you with a screwdriver before, and I wanted to save you from embarrassment. Don't forget these beautiful ladies are watching you."

"Repair the wheelchair?"

Confused, Gromov realized that Andrey and Samara started loudly to laugh as if they were sharing some private joke.

"You guys know each other?"

"Well, sort of." Samara wiped off the tears of laughter. "Excuse me, captain. I am sooo sorry."

"You don't seem too sorry to me. May I know what's happening here?"

"This is a secret," retorted Andrey. "You treated me like a mental, Sava. Now it's my turn for a little revenge. You will never know what happened between this fine lady and me. No one will ever tell you. Mystery of the universe stays closed before your very eyes, which will haunt you to the last breath."

Gromov sighed and turned to Samara. "If I understand correctly, the wheelchair of your aunt has broken, so you called Andrey. Have you met him before?"

Even though Andrey tried to hush Samara vehemently, she disregarded him and led Gromov outside, to a  garden, in which the flowers had begun blossoming.

The place did not match Gromov's memories, having been replaced by a more vivid, picturesque corner of a fairyland.

"Am I dreaming?" he pondered. But in normal dreams, such a realization was foreplay for waking up, while now, he only felt a tad hazy with his brain-altering between his old and current self.

"Dreaming?" she went on softly. "Should I explain where I met Jerzinsky?"

"No need."

He was already aware of that part since he had lived through this once. Samara had arrived in the city a week ago and gotten stuck at the airport with a load of baggage. Coincidentally, Andrey had been wandering around and offered her help, so they became acquaintances. When the wheelchair had broken down, she called Andrey.

Samara shrugged. "Still so impatient! A girl would think you didn't need to rush things, taking into account the circumstances. We have met again after so many years, Sava - but you made sure to burst the bubble of our happy reunion."

Gromov found her arguments reasonable. Was it really necessary to investigate the sudden, yet welcome mystery? All the regrets he had, he could face them in this weird dreamland, probing what would have happened if he had given a different answer to her.

But Samara did not look disappointed, wearing a cold, calculating expression.

"What if I let you kill my auntie and her dog today?" she suggested cooly. "Was a mistake to keep the history unaltered, playing my part accordingly and truthfully? What about you, Sava? Can't you just shut up and be thankful for the rare opportunity? Am I not the only love of your life?"

"The only love? Sounds so noble and haughty," Gromov grinned, even though he did not find it funny at all. "I've never admitted this."

"Neither have I. I repeat, Sava. We have both a rare opportunity. So I ask once again. Should I marry Peter?"

"The answer stays the same, Samara. You should marry him. You've already done so."

Back then, when Gromov had refused to confess his true feeling, the real Samara did not insisted, letting the matter slip as if it had never happened. Neither of them had crossed the thin line of expressing their affection explicitly.

"So be it!"

This dreamland Samara failed to reveal the tenderness of the real one, lacking the gentle confusion of the original. There was something inhuman in her motionless gaze, almost as if the was a sister to Doll, a robot sent from a distant past. A mere talking statue.

Without a warning, her skin changed color, turning into the dark blue. Certain sharpness, alwas present in her features, became more prominent, and the whites of her green eyes blackened.

"Do you recognize me?"

When Gromov was about fifteen, he read a comic book. The book was not special, but
