"Should I marry Peter?"

On his third vacation day, Samara contacted Gromov, and invited him to a small, comfy coffee. They were drinking vine while Gromov sourly desired something stronger. He knew the talk would be a disaster, but he could not help himself.

Samara wore a casual costume, giving away vibes of sucessful bussiness woman, while her smiles were charming hearts of men, no matter their age or status.

"Of course, you should marry Peter," Gromov replied nonchalantely. "He is handsome, nice, and smart. I wonder what makes you think you shouldn't. Nota bene, when you have already been engaged for a couple of months. By the way, do you mind me having, how do you call that, an aperitive? Hey, waiter, bring me double vodka, please."

"The same here!"

Samara pushed her vine away and watched him attentively. She had green, fox-like eyes with small wrinkles in corners, gentle nose, and lips with lipstick too red to Gromov's taste.

"Sava," she said. "Jerzinski had talked to me. He hinted you wouldn't be happy once you learn about Peter's proposal."

Samara always addressed Andrey by his surname. Originally, Gromov thought she did not like Andrey and tried to keep a distance from him since he was a noisy and unpolished "diamond in raw". But even so, she always insisted on meeting the both of them, treating Andrey like an old friend, sometimes almost making Gromov jealous. She acted more detached during the rare opportunities when she and Gromov were alone.  

"Peter is a fine fellow, my favorite buddy. Certainly better than certain chatter-box. I see no reason why I should not be happy."

"If I am not mistaken, I've met you two about a year ago," Samara sighed and put her slender hand on his. "Two brave soldiers who wanted to shoot my dog."

"It was not your dog. And Andrey did not shoot it."

"A pity because I would not mind. My aunt's dog is an ugly, pitiful creature."
