"Should I marry Peter?"

On his third vacation day, Samara contacted Gromov, and invited him to a small, comfy coffee. They were drinking vine while Gromov sourly desired something stronger. He knew the talk would be a disaster, but he could not help himself.

Samara wore a casual costume, giving away vibes of sucessful bussiness woman, while her smiles were charming hearts of men, no matter their age or status.

"Of course, you should marry Peter," Gromov replied nonchalantely. "He is handsome, nice, and smart. I wonder what makes you think you shouldn't. Nota bene, when you have already been engaged for a couple of months. By the way, do you mind me having, how do you call that, an aperitive? Hey, waiter, bring me double vodka, please."

"The same here!"

Samara pushed her vine away and watched him attentively. She had green, fox-like eyes with small wrinkles in corners, gentle nose, and lips with lipstick too red to Gromov's taste.

"Sava," she said. "Jerzinski had talked to me. He hinted you wouldn't be happy once you learn about Peter's proposal."

Samara always addressed Andrey by his surname. Originally, Gromov thought she did not like Andrey and tried to keep a distance from him since he was a noisy and unpolished "diamond in raw". But even so, she always insisted on meeting the both of them, treating Andrey like an old friend, sometimes almost making Gromov jealous. She acted more detached during the rare opportunities when she and Gromov were alone.  

"Peter is a fine fellow, my favorite buddy," Gromov insisted lightly. He did not lie, though. In his opinion, Peter Grasov possesed qualities a woman should appreciate in a man: reliable, succesful, handsome, and kind-hearted. Compared to Peter, Gromov felt unworthy. "I see no reason why I should not be happy."

"If I am not mistaken, I met you two about a year ago," Samara sighed and put her slender hand on his. "Two brave soldiers who wanted to shoot my dog."

"It was not your dog. And Andrey did not shoot it."

"A pity because I would not mind. My aunt's dog is an ugly, pitiful creature."

Gromov remembered this very encounter. Then, a strange thing happened. The stage had changed, almost like he was experiencing a flashback in a movie.

"Hello? Who? It's you ... No, no problem. The park just

He saw Andrey picking up his cellphone, talking to someone in a hushed voice.

In the late spring days, he and Andrey used to play chess in the park, drinking from a bottle, labeled as METHANOL FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.

After his second backup in a row, Andrey was under observation period, daily visiting the near hospital and out of duty. His mental state suffered because the detoriation caused by the backup became more prominent.

Their games of chess were less balanced, and Andrey complained that evaluating five moves ahead made his head hurt - which had never been an issue before. Due to his internal struggle with growing migraine, he tended to get irritated over small things.

Suddenly, he stood up with an angry expression and said to someone behind Gromov's back: "Hey beauty, the dog of yours seems to be my compatriot in pain. Do you mind if I kill it to shorten its suffering?"

When Gromov turned around, he spotted dark-haired lady with green eyes, thin lips, and well-defined cheekbones, clad in a black skirt and snow-white shirt, who wore a jacket over her forearm.

On a long leash, she was walking a grayish French bulldog. Wheezing, coughing, and breathing hardly, the animal bravely treaded the gravel path, with huge eyes almost popping out of shallow sockets. Every day in flat-faced dog's life had to be a constant purgatory.

The woman appeared taken aback for a while, evaluating both men and their SF uniforms. Finally as she came to a conclusion they do not pose any threat, she stopped and retorted calmly: "I do not mind at all, dear sir. Make a short work with this pitiful creature as you wish. But once you do that, please be sure to collect his dead body and accompany me back to my aunt who believes that the dog is the only pleasure of her existence."

With slightly curved lips, she approached Andrey and inspected his uniform: "Sergeant Jerzinski, is it?"

"That's right, madame. At your full disposal."

Since Andrey did not waver either, Gromov considered the option of jumping out and bursting into apologies. On the other hand, he thought, why should I be sorry for that moron?

The staring contest between Andrey and the young lady took about one long minute, during which Gromov experienced amusement and emberrasement simultanously.

Sardonically, the woman continued: "Since you are so fond of mercy killing, Sergeant Jerzinski, I wonder if you can do me a favor."

"With pleasure. Do you own more abused animals that need an extermination?"

"Sort of. As I said before, the dog belongs to my auntie, who is terminally ill. I am afraid that the very moment she realizes that the doggie left her side forever, she may get a bit upset. This will result likely into prolonged agony that should not left you undisturbed, given how caring human you appear to be. My request is simple. Come with me and send the doggie and my poor aunt on their last journey together."

"Only this?" Andrey sneered. "Have you an preferable order of how to perform these executions?"

"Most certainly," the woman nodded in satisfaction. "If you do not mind, my auntie first. She should depart with her beloved pet in arms, quitting the world without necessary pain and sadness. I hope you can manage this selfish request of mine, sergeant."

"No problem."

After the exchange, Gromov wished he could have disappeared. However, Andrey calmly packed up the chessboard, put chesspieces into the case, and gestured towards her.

"Lead the way, milady," he said. "Nobody can blame SF officers for abandoning their duty. May I introduce my colleague to you? This is Captain Gromov. I can imagine that seeing the upcoming scene (hopefully not too gory) will negatively affect your psyche, so you may want to seek a safe haven in his manly disposition."

Gromov made himself smaller. "I am a completely unrelated party."

At least, he wanted to clarify as much. But the moment, she came closer and examined him carefully, the same way she had done it with Andrey, he got captivated by her looks.

"So pleased to meet you, captain."

The offered hand had sensitive, slender fingers with long nails. From shoes to pearl necklace, she emanated an air of cultivated, fashion-aware woman, situated in the upper class. But she lacked the predatory hint often found (at least in Gromov's opinion) among wealthy people.

Even though he did not intend to get involved in Andrey's mess, he hardly resisted the attraction, caused by her natural charm. Still, he did not manage to smile back.

"Nice to meet you," he answered almost indifferently.

"Are you a pilot?"

"Right now I feel more like a warden warden of a mental asylum," replied Gromov, angrily staring at Andrey. "Please, do excuse him. My friend lives through harsh diffuculties, so he deems himself entitled to unforgivable rudeness. But rest assured, we are both harmless."

"Is it so?" She got closer to him and whispered. "With the regards to national security, I wonder if I should not be petrified if a SF officer admits he was harmless. Aren't you suppose to be, you know, dangerous, or threatening? Like a hyena?"

Hyena?

Gromov did not remember Samara ever talking about hyenas. Moreover, the scene he happened to be in felt somewhat unrealistic. Where the coffee went? Why was Andrey alive? Am I dying while flashbacks of my life wander before my eyes?

But he did not mind. There were two people he ever cared about. He obediently followed the suit, inquiring about Samara's circumstances.

"I am a new kid on the block," she chatted jovially. "My auntie left me walk her dog to get aquinted with new people. She said explicitly that men who care about animals cannot be bad. Futhermore, she explained to me I should contact SF officers if I get into trouble. She is sooo fond of SF officers. My uncle was one of them. I am pretty sure she will be very happy to meet you before, you know..."

She made a quick cutting movement around her neck.

"This..."

Uncomfortable to the bones, Gromov could not get rid of the impression she was doing it on purpose. Meanwhile, Andrey, walking few steps behind, wore a cruel expression of serial killer.

About ten minutes later, they stooped at an ornamental gates of a villa, located in an expensive neigborhood. Samara invited them inside and lead their party into exquisite lounge where an old lady sat on a wheelchair, accompanied by a nurse.

"Auntie, I'm home," Samara said and kissed the lady on forehead. "These gentlemen agreed to help us with the small problem of yours."

"Oh, so nice of you," the lady greeted them entusiatically. "My hubby always told me that the SF officers are the best. Samara has no friends here, and frankly, I would never expect anyone to take care of me at a moment notice. Splendid! I begged the company to come as soon as possible, but they decided to neglect my worsening conditions altogether."

"The company?"

Gromov wondered if she was reffering to some shady bussiness, involved in euthanasia. Suddenly, he spotted how Andrey was rolling up his sleeves.

"Do you want to make it here?" Andrey asked grimly.

"That would be lovely. Curently, I am not able to move elsewhere. It is so cumbersome that I prefer to stay downstairs. I had to ask Samara to walk my sweetheart because I'm stuck in the lounge. Quite disturbing situation I'm afraid. But with you here, I'm sure that all my trouble will vanish at once."

"Count on us!"

To Gromov's horror, Andrey came closer and observed the lady from all possible angles.

"No problem," he said to Samara afterwards. "Can I have some tools? Do you know where your aunt store knives? Paper towels can be handy as well. It may be a dirty work."

Samara nodded and brought a toolbox, from which Andrey took out a huge hammer.

"What are you going to do?"

Gromov could not take it anymore. After approaching Andrey, he took the hammer from his hands. "Seriously, even in your current state, you should know better."

"Oh, should I?" Andrey grinned. "So, will your majesty repair the bloody wheelchair? Because I saw you with a screwdriver before and I wanted to save you from emberassement. Don't forget these beautiful ladies are watching you."

"Repair the wheelchair?"

Confused, Gromov realized that Andrey and Samara started to laugh loudly as if they were sharing some private joke.

"You guys know each other?"

"Well, sort of." Samara wiped off the tears of laughter. "Excuse me, captain. I am sooo sorry."

"You don't seem too sorry to me. May I know what's happening here?"

"This is a secret," retorted Andrey. "You treated me like a mental, Sava. Now it's my turn for a little revenge. You will never know what happened between me and this fine lady. No one will ever tell you. Mystery of the universe stays closed before you very eyes, which will haunt you to your last breath."

Gromov sighed and turned to Samara. "If I understand correctly, the wheelchair of your aunt has broken, so you called Andrey. Have you met him before?"

Even though Andrey tried to hush Samara vehemently, she disregarded him and led Gromov outside, to a  garden, in which the flowers had begun blossoming.

The place did not match Gromov's memories, having been replaced by more vivid, pitoresque corner of a fairy land.

"Am I dreaming?" he pondered. But in normal dreams, such a realization was a foreplay for waking up, while now, he only felt a tad hazy with his brain altering between his old and current self.

"Dreaming?" she went on softly. "Should I explain where I met Jerzinsky?"

"No need."

He was already aware of that part since he had lived through this once. Samara had arrived to the city a week ago and gotten stuck on the airport with a load of baggages. Coincidentally, Andrey had been wandering around and offered her help, so they became aquintances. When the wheelchair had broken down, she called Andrey.

Samara shrugged. "Still so impatient! A girl would think you didn't need to rush things under such circumstances. We have met again after so many years, Sava, but you made sure to burst the bubble. What if I let you kill my auntie and her dog today? But I haven't change our history. I've played my part accordingly and truthfully. But what about you? Even in a wonderland, you keep analyzing the world instead of being thankful for the rare opportunity to meet the only love of your life."

"The only love? Sounds so noble and haughty," Gromov grinned. "I've never admitted this."

"Nor have I. I repeat, Sava. We have both a rare opportunity. I ask once again. Should I marry Peter?"

"The answer stays the same, Samara. You should marry him. You've already done so."
