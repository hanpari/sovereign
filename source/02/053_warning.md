# Warning

Gromov had several reasons why to dislike Professor Zhutra. The state, in which he grew up, was becoming more and more decadent while encouraging the so-called "freedom of education".

The main idea behind it came from the premise everyone was entitled to education of one's own choice.

The institutes, such as Zhutra's University of Enlighted mind, were offering the alternative - the enrichment (according to their opinions) of too materialistic world; and the only thing they had in common was the united front against natural sciences, especially mathematics.

Generally not useful, their graduatees created the loudest part of the society; not only obnoxious, but often even harmful.

Now one of them made the stupid mistake of smuggling a dangerous object to the ship of a man who did not excel in being tolerant, mainly if the safety would be compromised.

With interest of whole humanity being at stake, Gromov decided to pay meticulous attention to this accident, burning with sadistic pleasure.

A priest entering the den of sin, he unlocked his guests' door.

Knock! Knock!

"Oh, it's you? You look like attending a funeral."

With the air of noble woman having unsolicited visitors, Simone welcomed him like the last man she could have expected. "Come in, then."

"Not necessary. Here you are."

Gromov gave her a sealed envelop. "Take your access card. You have permission to enter the lounge, medical centre, and dining room."

"Great! So we are not your prisoners anymore?"

"Yes, the unbearable time of suffering has ended. Make it a story. Tortured and bullied by a perverted tyrant."

"Poor you. Did I hurt your feeling? But wait ..."

Simone tore the envelope open and frown: "Have you forgotten Khamal? There is only one card inside."

"I would never forget Professured Zhutra," Gromov ensured her. "Don't be ridiculous. The last hours he was the only one on my mind. You could say I had a very vivid dreams just because of our friend."

Simone kept frowning. "Why not to give the card to Khamal? Do you plan do have him locked till the end of our journey?"

"Quite the contrary, Miss Yeuxbleu. I plan to set Professor Zhutra free. Forever!"

Not exactly dimwitted, Simone immidiatelly realized the meaning of Gromov's bleaky talk and black suit, followed by the absense of the second card.

"You ..."

There was something gratifying in such a horrified expression. Under normal circumstances, a man would hurry up to dispell her worries, but now, Gromov only watched how that woman's confidence is crumbling apart.

"What do you intend to do with Khamal?"

"Miss Yeuxbleu, what about a little confession? Don't you have anything you'd like to admit?"

"No idea what you want to hear from me."

"Your reluctance makes you a culprit I guess," Gromov sighed. "Look, beauty. We both are aware of the fact Professor Khamal brought a forbidden item on my ship. The consequences are given and clearly explained. You had agreed to my terms before you embarked the ship. Even promises given under life threatening situations need to be honored."

Simone gasped: "You know about the egg? Have you been spying on us?"

Gromov decided not to answer. He ordered instead: "Be so kind and call your partner for me. The moment you warn him or try to refute my order, I'll lock the door and let both of you die slowly of thirst and hunger. No kidding."
