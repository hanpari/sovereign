# Probability

After he bid farewell to infuriated Simone, Gromov returned to his cabin to calm down. His dramatic departure felt like an act, written by a mediocre playwright.

"You killed me," he informed the impartial table. "And now I' m brokenhearted. Samara! Samara! My fiendish lover! Where are you, wife? I miss you!"

There was no response. Even Doll, forgotten on the charging pad, did not raise her blond head. She stood there, volupteous madonna of Luciano's art sessions, depicted in plethora of positions (the paintings on the wall with leifmotif of heroism and nudity belonged to very restrained department of Luciano's cranky fantasies), and strangely enough, she preffered staying quiet.

Usually, Doll would chime in with unsoliticed advertisement like "Frustrated, Captain Gromov? What about to forget about stress with Elenoar, an Elven archer? Not only her slender figure let you remember the wonderful days in the Middle Earth, but her virginity is there for you to take. Become an Orc on his plundering conquest. Hear fair maidens sing serene Elven sagas when mourning for their fall. Visit SEXYSEXYLADIES and apply for your Dark Inviders Campaign."

Now, the advertisement channel disappeared as if the armageddon had finally come. Gromov found it unnerving. Doll's promotions were annoying and could not be removed. According to the contract, Luciano bought a discounted model with mandatory advertisements played every three hours. Still, unsolicited or not, they had become part of the lonely daily routine.

The moment Gromov entered the cabin, Doll's proximity or noise sensors should have been triggered. Yet nothing happened.

"Doll! Doll! Doll!"

Slowly and reluctantly, the android opened the large blue eyes and performed a welcoming gesture in jerky manner that ressembled a winter statue, breaking out of frozen layers.

"Undergoing update. Please, wait."

"Update? What update?"

No one sane would allow to jam the precious and sluggishly slow ship bandwith for a to get new commercials from SEXYSEXYLADIES, no matter how desperately one craved for them.

"You are not downloading any data, aren't you?"

"No, Captain Gromov. This is an special, unplanned update, received for an internal source."

With ominious premonition, Gromov asked: "What source?"

"A trusted internal source. Would you like to check its signature?"

"Sure. Send it to my screen."

He had no hopes when he glanced over terminal screen. Except for a standard, uncomprehensible mess of brackets, dates, and hexadecimal codes, he found only one telling line:

The authorized source: S. Gromov

"Doll, I have no recollection of becoming a programmer. Don't tell me that Uriah guessed my password?"

Even though not in shape to profit out of it, Uriah attempted several times to override Doll's settings and order the android to dance a striptease show, the only function he still could enjoy.

"No, Captain Gromov. Mr. Uriah Uriah does not have any access to the system. Since the time you threatened Mr. Uriah Uriah with crippling his hands, he had not tried to violate my protocols. Allow me to remind you this sort of foreplay is illegal even with the consent of harmed party."

"It was just a figure of speech," grunted Gromov. "When has the update begun?"

"Before one hour."

"Is it only you what has been getting updated?"

"No, Captain Gromov. The whole ship system is being rewritten. It is authorized by the user S. Gromov."

"I haven't authorized anything."

"Correct. Your personal account name is Sava Gromov. The user S. Gromov authorized the process three hours ago."

"So there are two accounts under my name?"

"Correct. Both posess the highest level of rights."

"When the second account has been created?"

"Forthy eight hours and thirty minutes ago."

After some mental arithmetic, Gromov concluded Doll indicated the time he was dreaming about Samara.

"Thank you, Doll. I presume there is no way to stop those updates, isn't it?"

It was just a rhetorical question. Normally, no space ship would undertake changes in their software on the fly; and if so, the update would be only partial,  under strict surveillence. But now, something or someone started a huge overhaul, neglecting all safety concers. Interrupting it in the middle would likely required reboot of the ship, which was nothing he or his passangers could survive.

'If you can do nothing about it, stop complaining.' This was the golden rule of Space Forces. More than anything, the adage expressed the resignation on any effort to improve the current state of affairs. Right now, Gromov felt he could only pay attention to the matters within his capacity. After all, solving issues of software was beyond him.

"Doll, I need you to play a game with me."

"I love playing games. Dear Luciano taught me so many of them. Which one do you have on your mind, Captain Gromov?"

"Coin flipping. Here you are. Take this one and get ready. I need you to flip the coin, put in on the desk and cover it with this book. Then, you'll write my guess on the paper, take a photo of the coin and the paper together. Is it clear enough?"

"Absolutely. I'm so thrilled!"

"If so, let's do it. Wait until I leave the cabin. You have to be alone before you begin. I'm leaving now."

Once she had invited him back, Gromov looked at the desk and focused on the book to see through it.

"Head! Write it down and then check the result, Doll. In this order. Don't forget to take the photo and... What the hell are you doing?"

Dressed up in white nurse costume with adorable hat on her head and hair tightened into an elegant bun, Doll pulled out hairpins and loosened blond strands over her shoulders.

"You guessed correctly, you nasty cheater. If you are lucky next time, you'll have me unbutton my blouse."

"I curse you, Luciano! Doll, you're not letting me win on purpose, aren't you? I forbid you to do so!"

"Of course not."

To be on the safe side, the second game, Gromov lost intentionally to verify whether Doll would continue her striptease or not.

"Wrong guess, Captain Gromov," she reported. "A pity you won't see my underwear."

"A pity, indeed."

Originally, Gromov intented to win every game, but now when he could not be sure whether Luciano had not instructed Doll to give her owner some undeserved favors, he decided to keep records on his own, altering "right" and "wrong" randomly in controlled fashion.

"We'll continue on a pure academic basis."

Only when Doll threw away her skirt, it came to him there was no need for unnecessary undressing.

"As you wish, Captain Gromov. But I have no data related to that pure academic basis. But I'm more than willing to learn new things."

"Just stop distracting me."

After one hundred tosses, Gromov closed the experiment and start comparing his numbers with photos even though the result had been already clear. He knew he did not fail in a single case.

To his knowledge, he had done everything to exclude possibility of external manipulation with the outcome. He even recorded the whole session on camera to be sure that no force was in charge of his body.

Almost paranoid, he prevented even the most unlikely scenarios - or at least he hoped so. Still, there were no doubts.

"It appears I've developed supernatural powers."

Curiously enough, Doll was not impressed. "What does it mean, Captain Gromov?"

"It means that if I were an idiot, I'd ask you to sew for me an elastic fancy overall and start calling myself Roentgenman."

"I love cosplay!"

"If so, cosplay yourself into the less revealing getup. Since Professor Zhutra won't need your gentle care, you can discard your nurse costume."

"Discard? Captain Gromov, you are such a sweetheart! Will you buy me new one? Would you like pick a costume for me? SEXYSEXYLADIES got you covered."

"Sure, sure. You have my promise - supposing we'll survive Samara's synthesis. And the ongoing update of the ship system. And the nuclear annihilation from Space Forces. Thinking of it, your chances to milk some money out of me are miniscules."

"Wonderful!"

Since SEXYSEXYLADIES treated their customers like Pavlov's dogs, Doll's artificial inteligence decided to play a joyous etude and throw Doll into Gromov's arms. Before he could protest, Doll kissed Gromov seducively, leecherously pressing her body on the man.

With fresh memories of the encounter with Simone, Gromov let his hands wander on the android, amused by own today's successful rate. After comparing organic versus anorganic female life forms, he had to admit he prefered the latter more. Doll's skin felt colder, drier, and smoother. Her facial features looked perfect even without make-up and her unrealistic figure promised unimaginable pleasures, had he ever considered to make love with her.

But no matter how Doll insisted and pushed, she could not raise the mindless frenzied reaction he had tasted with Simone Yeuxbleu. Perhaps it was caused by her fragrant perfume that missed the proper cocktail of pheromones of perhaps Gromov's brain recognized the subtle difference, similar to how taste buds distinguised between processed and home-made meal.
