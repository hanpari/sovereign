SIMONE'S DIARY

...

Heavens must hate me. The emergency communication is on and airing. Our coordinates exposed to all Universe. Dwarfus has just informed me. I had an hysterical outburst. Because of that, Their fighter has already had to start. I went to such great lengths to save the egg from their clutches, and for what? I'll eliminate Dwarfus with pleasure.

...

Tonight is the night. Dwarfus should be removed from my way. After this, I
ll take the egg and jump into outer Space. This is the plan. Not a pleasant vista, but I cannot think out how to prevent Them to lay Their dirty hands on the egg. It is a disturbing image, flying away with the artifact I'm ruined my life for.
Waiting for Dwarfus to fall asleep. I don't want to stay alone. I don't want to die this way! I'm crying and thinking of Monkeis and Mastodontus. Sentimental bitch! Sentimental bitch! Sentimental bitch!

The same day, later
Dwarfus heard me and consoled me. If anything, I have recovered my pride. I'm still not so low to seek solace with him.

...

The execution postponed. Someone received our SOS. Cannot believe it.If I were religious, I'd call it a miracle. In the vast empty space, there is a freightship nearby. Dwarfus excited, I not so much. The first rule of what They taught me: Space is deaf even if you yell. No one would risk their lives in such a fool's errand.

The same day later
They are changing their course towards us. No hesitation at all. Idiots? Heroes? The captain keeps repeating instructions to Dwarfus, planning an emergency extraction. He must be either a fool or a master pilot. Probably the former. It's clear as a day the freightship is not exatly suited for subtile maneuvering. That man is very short-tempered. Twenty minutes in conversation with Dwarfus and he prefers to speak with me. Dwarfus' ego hurts. He is in charge and he dosn't like being belittled this way.

...

The extraction succesful! Everything went surprisingly smoothly. It took three attempts to connect our ship. Incredible! The captain of the freightship must be competent beyond belief. But Dwarfus thinks he is a klutz. So funny considering Dwarfus had never had an opportunity or wish to switch to manual. He don't realize that a tiny mistake could damage the freightship.

The egg is with us. I made a half-hearted attempt to convince Dwarfus to leave it behind, but I'm sure he intends to smuggle it. Envisioning himself being a Mr. Millionaire. Too bad the captain is overly cautious. We had to strip off all clothes except for underwear. Dwarfus got offended. Worrying about his little buttocks? This was the golden chance I had been waiting for. I picked up the most revealing bikini I could found. The captain must be lonely, right? I'll befriend him in no time.

The same day later
Finally met with Hyenus and his bizzare crew. If he is a space merchant, I'll eat my shirt. He reminds me of the camp instructor. Could he be one of Them? But he did not respond to any of my secret signals. So I played my typical dumb and woke Simone. Not appreciated at all. He seems to disdain this sort of people. Especially Dwarfus. Never before Dwarfus has been hinted so many times he was a stupido. Amusing! And I had a shower!

The same day later
Hyenus brought our belongings. Half-naked and clean, I opened the door. Once again, not appreciated. Staring directly to my eyes, a proper gentleman. Not interested in women? So confusing! The walls of the ship are full of erotic paintings. And he has a female sex android to satisfy his needs, so why not to react to me as well? A bit demotivating to lose the battle against a mere robot.

Still, he discovered the egg and thinks it is a weird decoration. A good time to vent my anger on Dwarfus. I slapped him as hard as possible. The huge and indescribable relief! Pure joy! But being with the imbecil locked for more days again! Give me a break!

Hyenus doesn't trust us. We are temporary prisoners now.
