Hyenus kept inquiring about Him. Reevaluating my opinion a bit. He instantly discerns the contradictional claims in the Brown's narrative. What a nitty-picking bastard! I really must act accordingly. Got to used to alternative mentals from the University of Enlightened Idiocy. Forgot there are still people who can understand and analyze facts. The conversation with a normal thinking human being is so refreshing. But dangerous! Treading on the thin ice everywhere.

Fortunatelly, he was stricken by another fit before he could dig any deeper. Before he collapsed, he said he was seeing ghosts. Clearly a man who should've never obtained the piloting license.

Did my best to keep him alive. Several moments I doubted he could make it. For five long minutes, he stopped breathing and had no pulse. Panicking. Without him the ship is useless. It would be great but I cannot exclude the possibility the ship has tracking emitter. Better sticking to the plan and become Hyenus' lover.

I was so relieved to see him coming back that I almost fail to play dumb Simone. So I started to hit him hard to get him distracted. It worked. My first aid displeased him.
