After the shocking revelation, Gromov asked Doll to highlight the passages that proved her claim. Even though this should be a challenging task for the android, she prepared the requested compilation in a few seconds, taking him by surprise.

This was something beyond any artificial intelligence. Not only did Doll have to scan a long list of personal entries, but she also had to decipher intentionally obscured wording.

For instance, Simone loved to refer to people around her by nicknames that she had coined for them. So, Khamal Zhutra became Dwarfus, and Gromov became Hyenus. The other female students from Zhutra's spaceship ended up as Micies, Sabies, and Lalies.

In general, Simone adopted the rule to denigrate men and ridicule women. The first group usually received insulting, and the second group silly nicknames. The tradition started with her father and mother, who were labeled Mastodontus and Monkies.

"At least, she dislikes both equally," grunted Gromov.

The first contact with the DOZOR happened when Simone had gotten infatuated with the history of The Emperor In The Mask. As a teenager, she was impressed by his accomplishments and honored him by capitalized, magnificent He.

'I'm sick of those ignorants who can't understand His true self,' she wrote. 'If He had become a threat, whose fault is it? The bastards who pushed into the abyss - I wish I could travel back in time and weed them out without mercy. Just the notion of DOZOR still existing makes me nauseous. But the bait is ready.'

Whatever the bait was, the fish had been caught. This was the part from which Doll concluded that Simone planned to join DOZOR. After that, DOZOR had never been mentioned directly. Cautiously, Simone used further on capitalized They or simply called DOZOR the organization. How and why DOZOR decided to approach her remained unclear. But Simone expected they would come eventually.

…

'A contact with the dubious outcome. Still, hurray! It was a frightening experience to deal with Them. I didn't need to act because I was genuinely scared. The first thing they told me: Mastodontus and Monkies will suffer if I ever mention our appointment. 

I played my role accordingly. Please, do not hurt them. I do love them! Why have you contacted me? Who are you? What do you want?

They told me I didn't need to know. They were very curious about my posts and articles. According to them, the young people usually tend to idolize Him or fail to understand why He was such a threat. 

With the cue, I spouted hysterically what They wanted to hear. Monster! Dictator! Fag! Whatever insult I could throw His way, I did it. They were obviously satisfied, and before leaving, They put a prospect in front of me. 

The University of Enlightened Mind. The worst canal of so-called alternative education? Do They want me to go there? Do They test my obedience? Should I ruin my life to show my sincerity? Whatever!

…

Never seen Mastodontus so infuriated! What heinous vocabulary! Monkies covering her ears and protecting me behind her fragile back. Funny, funny scene. 

Very eloquently, I expressed my love for alternative science. If facts do not correspond with what we want to believe, perhaps our subconsciousness hints to us about the hidden truth. Hilarious! 

Studying the university prospect gave me tremendous insight into how to turn Mastodontus on. A heart rate about one thousand, nearing stroke, spitting saliva like a madman! Monkies crying. The best day of my life. I had to run away, or they saw I was laughing like an idiot.

…

Officially on the run. Not coming home anymore. I didn't expect it. I wanted to come back as usual, but They interfered. Again, again, They are so scary. They knew what had happened. They were impressed by my dedication to Their thing. The probation period is over. So now, I am a runaway, but in fact, I'm heading to some training camp. It's my first time in Space, and I feel free like a bird.

…

We are in the middle of nowhere. All my fellow students are impressed. The camp is called Shepherds of Freedom. The omnipresent slogan: Without us, freedom and democracy will perish. On constant surveillance!
…

Just come from a tactical training. Too tired to write more. 

…

Help! I've just killed a man. He was of Elven origin; they're genetically modified people with prolonged ears. They are all staunch supporters of Him. They do believe in His return, so they decided to change their appearance to distinguish themselves from us. Why? I have no idea. 

The man was brave enough. When he saw me with the handgun, he smiled and said: "If I am worthy, our Masked Lord will revive me." They tortured him, crippled his hands, pulled out his nails, and burnt him with flame. I had enough. I shot him dead. I was about to cry; to hide it, I yelled and spat at his dead body. A show for the hidden camera. 

They praised me in front of all students. "Not all of you," the instructor said, "passed the exam. You are weak. It was not a human you should've killed today. It was a subhuman, a brainwashed, genetically adjusted monstrosity. Only one of you did it right."
Competent me, obviously.

…

Another one down. Not even my turn to do it. Kiddus should've done that. But he cannot. He still doesn't get what this place is. He thought joining Them was what cool kids do. But he doesn't have a stomach to be here. They brought an Elven woman. Thirty years old. She was crying and begging. Mother of two children. She swore she didn't follow Him. "I have long ears, but I don't believe in Him. It's not my fault I was born this way. Please, let me go!"

So Kiddus gave up, put the gun away, and thought it was over. The naïve bastard. That woman was as good as dead. He should've known it. The dimwit doesn't get Them right. Sure, the cool organization that protects human rights. So the instructor asked if someone had a different opinion. Everybody's silent. Not me. I need to convince Them I'm the fanatic they do love. They'd kill her anyway. With that in my mind, I raised my hand. And the rest is history. I hope her children are already dead. I don't think I can shoot them. I'm already on my limit. 

…

Kiddus approached me. He berated me. He called me a monster. He told me he spoke with the others, and he wanted to quit. From the position of the greater good, he explained to me there was no return for me. He just wanted me to know he would report the instructor and me to Them. "The superiors need to know!" Alright! He is annoying. There are cameras everywhere. Does he really believe the instructor smuggled those Elves here behind the organization's back? What can I do? What can I do? There are cameras. They already know. I have to report Kiddus. That's my only choice.

…

Of course, they knew. The instructor was ready and satisfied. "We need to be harsh," he said solemnly. "Otherwise, we do not deserve our freedom. He is a soft child. I'm afraid he shouldn't have gotten here. Sometimes, Simone, we have to take care of our own. We must remove rotten apples from our harvest. Do you understand?"

The gun is ready. He wants me to shoot Kiddus? Easy-peasy, my friend. Like I care for the others. But Kiddus is nice and quite likable. He is a big guy; he likes to laugh. Not the worst out there. He is not the brightest, for sure. Why did he make the mistake and let Them take him here? Was it intentional? The rotten apple doomed to fail eventually? How many of us will survive? Whatever. I'll don't let myself down. Not my fault Kiddus is an outlier.

…

It's done. Still shaking. Kiddus is no more. I took him by surprise. No explanation. Quick and sweet execution. The others yelled at me, but they were scared they'd be the next. Cowards! I didn't ask them to come here. What they thought before they'd agreed? Enjoy the bitter taste of your freedom.

…

The others hate me. Bessie keeps calling me a murderer. She is good. She was forced to kill her first yesterday. But I am worse than her because I didn't cry all night after like her? Or because I was the first in this messy business?

…

As of today, the baptism time is over. We all have at least one Elf under our belts. Even Rodus got one. He is psycho. He was looking forward to his turn and kept blabbering about how weak the others were. Well, he was disappointed. He got a man. But still, we heard shots and cries for a good hour. Rodus would endure more, but the Elf gave up due to the blood loss.

…

I got promoted. Now I'm the team leader. I'm ordering around the bunch of students that hate me and fear me. Fortunately, the training camp seems to be over soon.

…

We are leaving. They divided us into two groups. I was in the smaller group. They gave us guns. The instructor congratulated us on becoming a part of the organization. Wondering if the victory was worth it. But still, we were lucky. The bigger group failed the final exam. We shot them. But if only that! We were allowed to do it the way we liked it. And how do we like it? The instructor told us we all had very special qualities. I could see these qualities myself.

When the bigger group understood what's happening, they panicked. I don't blame them. Did I mention they hated me? So they started running away from me. Bessie fled to Rodus because she had been flirting with him for weeks. "Protect me!" She really thought Rodus would care. He was in the smaller group for a good reason. He didn't kill her; he just shot her leg to save Bessie for later. And he started to do the same thing with the other girls, hunting them down like rabbits.

So I went to Bessie. When she saw me, she cried. She even called Rodus for help. The bottom of stupidity! Not that he could hear her. I just wanted to shorten her suffering. Not let Rodus have his way. I told her to close her eyes. She was not listening to me. Crying till the end. Then, I continued in Rodus' feet. Too late, he realized I was killing off his playthings.

He was angry. He began arguing with me. Calling me names. I was trying to stay calm. Just provoking him. Waiting for him to make a mistake. He had a gun. Me too. When he raised the barrel towards me, I shot him. The instructor didn't like it, but no big deal. Perhaps they prefer psychopaths over sadists. Who knows?

After the bloodshed, the instructor had a word with me. He became sentimental. He apologized that he had to be strict. "You see. Our thing needs us to sacrifice ourselves." So far, I saw only other people being sacrificed but whatever! He hugged me and told me if he had a daughter, he would want her to be like me. I was honored. I told him Mastodontus sucked a big deal. But I don't call the instructor daddy. Perhaps he wanted me to do so, but I could not. I would go hysterical if I did so. I can't stop giggling now. So glad It's over.

…

On my way to get my education. The University of Enlightened Mind awaits. I can't believe they really want me there.'
