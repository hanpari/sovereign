After a short exchange on the topic of human rights that was lengthy and meaningless as those debates tended to be, Gromov escorted both "prisoners" to the medical center.

"Against my will," muttered Professor Zhutra. "Against my will."

The student, Simone, complied silently, warringly watching Uriah and his shabby weapon. In Gromov's opinion, she misinterpreted hacker's shaking body as a threat. But the Uriah's excitement slowly vanished, replaced by inevitable fatigue of the collapsing organism.

After Gormov locked up the door, he relaxed: "Finally, it is done. Next time, Uriah, we will ignore everyone asking for our help. Screw all charity. Did you make the arrangements in their cabin?"

"Completely, sir. I used the finest equipment available."

Saying that, Uriah started winking frantically. 

"What is it, Uriah. Something in your eyes?"

"No, sir. Just..."

Uriah winked again with the most lewd expression he was capable of.

Ignoring these conspicious hints, Gromov took Uriah's spear, and walked him to the cabin.  Uriah trembled with exhaustion, every muscle of his  malnourished body vibrating, with breath as hard as if he was running a marathon.

"Lie down, you moron," said Gromov gently. "You did well."

"Thank you, sir. I am fine. Few seconds and I'll be as good as new."

With these words, Uriah fell asleep at once. In the Space Forces, Gromov saw a fair share of dying or dead people, but none of them looked more dead than Uriah, whose pale complexion, almost non-existent movement of the chest, and position of crossed hands evoked an forgotten vampire, resting inside the abandoned tomb, surrounded by magnificent serenity and calmness. 

The grave atmosphere affected Gromov, so he sighed in relief when he closed the door and met familiar walls, covered in naughty Luciano's paintings. 

The white-winged angels, hovering over decaying corpses, soldiers crying in pain, and horses with broken legs, all of this bore completely different meaning now, almost like an infernal memento, pushed on him as a reminder of human mortality.

"I have to ask Doll to remove this morbid garbage and replace it by Hieronimus Bosch. It will be more cheerful this way," muttered Gromov. 

[H. Bosch was a Dutch/Netherlandish painter from Brabant, famous for pitoresque depictions of Christian Hell and Heaven - Pavel Morava's remark]

Dwelling no further in bleaky halls, he headed to the extraction chamber and climbed through the passage to retrieve personal belongins of his new passangers.

There were horrible stench coming from inside, nausating to such an extent that Gromov put on oxygen mask, supressing the urge to vomit. 

In the corner of the cabin, a dead body of a young woman, wrapped in a transparent plastic foil, laid on the floor, unceremonialy hidden behind tool boxes as if not to disturb the remaining survivals.

"That guy is truly impressive."

Seeing the scene, Gromov had to admire Professor Zhutra's spirit. "Nagging about human rights after this horror. A complete idiot, indeed."

Gromov quickly checked prepared luggage, inspecting the content. The only unusual thing, besides fancy underwear, was a huge egg-shaped metal object, looking like a decoration. 

"So heavy! What is it made of?" he pondered. Even without gravity, he could estimate the weight of that enormous item, just by its resistance to the applied force. "I will charge them handsomely to get it back to the Advanced Nations."

With no intention to stay more than necessary, he grabbed the belongings and transport them back to his ship. With certain pity, he left the dead woman behind. 

Then, he detached both spaceships from each other and begun meticulous inspection of every piece of inventory he had retrieved. Since he found nothing dangerous, he took the personal baggages and brought them to his guests.

After he unlocked the cabin, he knocked and waited for someone to open the door. Wrapped to a white towel, Simone appeared with wet hair and drops of water under her chin. 

"Oh, it's you," she said. "I have to thank you, Captain Gromov. The shower made me feel like in paradise. But I still could not get rid of that horrid stench. It is everywhere on me. Rest assured I smell more nicely and look less greasy. Normally, I would never allow any man to see me like this."

"I see no particular difference," Gromov mumbled. Noticing how the woman's eyes widened in shock, he regretted his remark. "Is Professor Zhutra alright?"

"Khamal? Sure, he is taking the shower now. Please, do not take his whining personally. He was on his edge when you had rescued us, not thinking clearly. After some rest, I believe, he'll be a completely different person. You will enjoy our company, granted."

"You don't need to please me, Miss Yeuxbleu. You may not understand why I was acting that way, but I had few encounters with space pirates, and pirates are rather an unpleasant bunch of people."

"You don't say." Simone did not seem convinced. Gromov felt she was making fun of him.

"About ten years ago," he said, "I and my colleagues were hunting certain a drug dealer that were hiding in Rusty Asteroids. Since we were supposed to deal with space pirates - I believe they called themselves free traders back then - our superiors deemed necessary to provide us with a presentation, covering the pirates' most glorious achievements. Among other, the free traders robbed a spaceship with settlers, murdering all two hundreds people aboard. If I recall corectly, they herded them into a small confinement, and push them into the outer space. For a reason beyond my comprehension, the pirates filmed the venue with slowmotion cameras, hovering in spacesuits between dying men, women, and children, having apparantly good fun."

"Sure. May I ask since when do merchants hunt mafiosos? Not that I'm doubting your words, but you do not strike me like a man, hardened in thousands battles. Aren't you rather an aspiring artist?"

With the obvious irony, Simone waved her hand toward Luciano's paintings. "Captain Gromov, do not misunderstand. Even though I do not mind you being concerned about your safety, just please, make your stories more believable. I guess you found the video somewhere on the Darknet, when you were browsing some nasty porn. Am I right?"

In awe, Gromov was at loss of words. After a short consideration, he nodded in defeat. "You are a very keen observer, Miss Yeuxbleu. Being a space merchant is a lonely job, so beside saving an unthankful lot, I have never had anything better to do than watching perverted videos and painting halfnaked valkyries. By any chance, since you are the Professor Zhutra's students, aren't you both involved in psychology? I really enjoy having my exposed soul dissected in this manner."

"Oh, I hope I didn't insult you.
