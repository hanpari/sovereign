The situation was no longer under control. Paranormal occurences kept popping up like in a crazy horror house, never letting spectators, belted on their seats, to breath out in relief.

But the safety belt seemed to crack, threatening Gromov to become one of the monsters in panopticum.

Not only had Doll's transformation surprised him, but her acknowledgement of Samara's existence counted like confirmation by an independent observer.

Since never before was Plantarian virus reported to affect artificial beings,  Gromov concluded that the power raiding his ship was something else.

Just thinking of it gave him a headache. Had he accepted the existence of The Emperor In The Mask, an unrivaled genius, who had allegedly prepared a background for steering the future of humankind, then he could explain everything in a simplistic fashion.  The evil guy did it!

On the other hand, Gromov was not aware of any organization or individual in the Solar System that could grant a sex android self-awareness or enable a mortal man to see through solid objects without specialized gadget, not to speak of transcendent being appearing and reappearing like a ghost.

With reluctance, he had to admit that the power surpassed him, so trying to go against it was as meaningful as fighting with a knife against a tank.

With no other choice than to wait until the mysterious synthesis was finished, he chose to take a nap.

Meanwhile, Doll put on a surprisingly decent Victorian garment, sat down into a Gromov's armchair and read Jane Austen's book from Luciano's collection, the charging pad situated comfortably under her feet.

The picture exuded serene atmosphere of long-lost times and was a complete fake. To Gromov's knowledge, Doll could absorb electronic books in astonishing speed, so the archaic paperbook was there only for show.

Doll's new personality developed in accordance with information imposed so far on her. The initial AI merged with Gromov's and Luciano's books and the interactions with the surrounding world.

In a few hours, Luciano's classics had prevailed, and Doll adopted an identity of a "corporate runaway" born into a noble family. She gradually insisted on calling Gromov "My dearest father" and treated him as such.

Unfortunately, the original programming lingered underneath, so her daughter-like affection bore traits of palpable sluttiness.
