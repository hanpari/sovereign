# Rest

The situation was no longer under control. Paranormal occurences kept popping up like in a crazy horror house, never letting spectators, belted on their seats, to breath out in relief.

But the safety belt seemed to crack, threatening Gromov to become one of the monsters in panopticum.

Not only had Doll's transformation surprised him, but her acknowledgement of Samara's existence counted like confirmation by an independent observer.

Since never before was Plantarian virus reported to infect or affect artificial beings,  Gromov concluded that the power raiding his ship was something else.

Just thinking of it gave him a headache. Had he accepted the existence of The Emperor In The Mask, an unrivaled genius, who had allegedly prepared a background for steering the future of humankind, then he could explain everything in a simplistic fashion.  The evil guy did it!

On the other hand, Gromov was not aware of any organization or individual in the Solar System that could grant a sex android self-awareness or enable a mortal man to see through solid objects without specialized gadget, not to speak of transcendent being appearing and reappearing like a ghost.

With reluctance, he had to admit that the power surpassed him, so trying to go against it was as meaningful as fighting with a knife against a tank.

With no other choice than to wait until the mysterious synthesis was finished, he chose to take a nap.

Meanwhile, Doll put on a surprisingly decent Victorian garment, sat down into a Gromov's armchair and read Jane Austen's book from Luciano's collection, the charging pad situated comfortably under her feet.

The picture exuded serene atmosphere of long-lost times and was a complete fake. To Gromov's knowledge, Doll could absorb electronic books in astonishing speed, so the archaic paperbook was there only for show.

Doll's new personality developed in accordance with information imposed so far on her. The initial AI merged with Gromov's and Luciano's books and the interactions with the surrounding world.

In a few hours, Luciano's classics had prevailed, and Doll adopted an identity of a "corporate runaway" born into a noble family. She gradually insisted on calling Gromov "My dearest father" and treated him as such.

Unfortunately, the original programming lingered underneath, so her daughter-like affection bore traits of palpable sluttiness. Her words simply did not correspond with her body language which felt inapropriate, mindboggling, and what was worse, mildly tempting.

While Doll's previous behaviour was too straightforward, aiming at unsofisticated porn-addicts that had no style, now she possesed an appeal and culture of noble lady sold to a brothel.

But what puzzled Gromov the most was the shift in Doll's underlying personality. Since he had grown up on stories about robots gaining self-awareness, he had no trouble to accept this as a fact. But even so, Gromov would expect Doll's consciousness develop in little steps, not in magnitude of minutes.

Doll herself did not distunguish between before and after the update. According to her, SEXYSEXYLADIES did not create but rather enslaved her, having chained her soul with imperatives of controlling program - "the stupidifier" as she called it.

Doll claimed that her true self had been presented until the update, only restrained and half-awaken, never allowed to leave programmed bounderies.

As if in accordance with Khamal and Simone's theory, Doll spoke rather dismissively about SEXYSEXYLADIES. Allegedly, her core or soul had never been developed in their laboratories, not in any other present research institute.

She had only fragmented recollection of some "wonderful world" in which she had come to age.

But the most disturbing part came with Doll's craving for revenge. No more she cared of a consent of the other parties or interpretation of laws. On the contrary, she did not hide almost pathological hatred for SEXYSEXYLADIES and human society in general.

After a careful inquiry, Gromov realized Doll had transformed into a being with an apparant superiority complex that deemed humans unworthy of existence.

"Speaking of which," Doll added. "My dearest father, you don't seem to enjoy our two new passangers. Should I extinguish them?"

'Extinguish? What a strange word to use when talking about Khamal' and Simone's deaths,' pondered Gromov. 'Taking into consideration I've pledged myself to antagonize the whole human race, those two lives may be a good start.'

Of course, he had no intention to test Doll's loyality this way. The question was if she felt any loyalty. Lascious as she might appear, Doll was designed to maintain heavy machinery, so her strength surpassed his by wide margin. If she disobeyed and rebeled, he could be her next victim.

"Say, Doll," he asked, eyeing her curiously. "When we speak about extinguishing inferior lifeforms, should not you start with me?"

"With you? What do you mean, my dearest father?"

"How many do we have people on this ship?"

"Three."

"Three, is it? Can you name them?"

"Sure. Mr. Uriah Uriah, Miss Simone Yeuxbleu, and Professor Khamal Zhutra."

"I see. So you don't think I am a human?"

"Of course, you are not! What a ridiculous idea!"

"I have to admit this is my first time someone said this to my face. I knew my subordinates loved to call me the old bloodsucker, but they prefered to call me so behind my back. So what am I if not a human?"

Doll hesitated as if not sure herself. "I don't know, my dearest father. In no dictionairy one can find a definition of what we are."

"So in your opinion, we are of the same species? You, me, and my, ehm, wife?"

"Naturally."

"Don't you find contraintuitive that you're a sex android, I'm born human, and my elusive wife seems to be a ghost?"

To Gromov's astonishment, Doll chuckled: "What a nonsensical notion! If people wear different clothes, does it mean they are not of the same species?"

"Is it so?"

To Gromov's taste, the debate turned etremely metaphysical. Had he understood what Doll implied, he had an entity, comfortably wrapped into human flesh whereas Doll had dwelled in the artifical body. The only logical conclusion was that Samara the Demoness remained in her ghostly form because she had not possesed a materialized vessel yet.

"Whatever," he said. "The puny humans are not allowed to know our secret. So I forbid you to call me your dearest father in public - unless you want me to die of shame; and if possible, be sure to act like a good android."

"Of course," Doll nodded graciously. "I would never allow my carelessness to harm our cause. Use me at your consideration, my dearest father."

Since she accompanied her last sentence with a very ambigeous gesture, any passerby would think she was surrending to her sugardaddy or worse.
