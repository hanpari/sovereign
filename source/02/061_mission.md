# Mission

...

Now I'm a student. The lady in office had all paperwork ready. One would expect someone more eerie at The University that teaches metaphysics, but sadly enough, the personnel here is recruited from ordinary people. Still, there was a slogan above her head.

BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
REALITY IS A MERE DISTRACTION

I wish Mastodontus could see that.

...

Got my first paycheck. No need to look for part-time job I guess. I'm an consultant at Guardians of Democracy, a non-govermental organization I've never heard of and never visited before.

I called there. Very decent people. They looked me up in their database and confirmed my paycheck was no mistake. As for my assignment, I should consult my superior. Who the hell is my superior? Nobody knows. But money landed on my account. Thirty thousands! Not bad for doing nothing. As the instructor promised my living expenses got covered.

...

Found myself an appartmant. Too huge for my need, but I'm supposed to socialize with other students. And perhaps, I should pay a visit to GoD to show my face there.

...

Longus No.3 broke up with me. The reason? I am not emotionally attached. No idea what he was talking about. Our relationship lasted for three months and I've been accomodating him like no other girl before. Still, he said to me, he feels like I was just pretenting. Right he is! But this is not the point.

The point is how he has figured me out? Are my acting skills lacking? Sure, I am emotionally detached. Who wouldn't be taking into the account what I had undergone in that training camp. Inside me, I'm broken beyond repair. But he shouldn't have found out. I was such a sweet loving girl. Longus No.1 and No.2 did not complain. Ever!

I think he's a pussy. Would a normal guy care about my deeper soul? Would not be a normal guy be happy if I told him he was the best? I took care of him in every possible aspect. Watching TV? Fine with me. Leaving with friends? No big deal. All my efforts into drain.

Have to call Besties No. 1 and No.2 and make a scene or something. This is what I am supposed to do, right? To wash my sorrow by gin and yell there are no good men anymore. The last time we did it, we went to watch and enjoy male stripters.

...

My diploma work done and sent. Claiming He was a latent homosexual. Afraid my work doesn't prove my claim at all, but who cares? My sources are doubtful to say the least, but my supervisor wave that off. "Your heart provides you the guidance." In fact, she considers my work rather rigorous. I'm the only student who bothered with references. The others've just submitted something what can be called an essey at the best.

...

No idea if They pulled the strings but my diploma work got an award. Seriously?

...

Besties No.1 got a job. She's gonna be an official at the Ministry of Agriculture. She has no qualification. Her only concern? The color of her suit for the first day at the office. Besties No.2 is jelous.

...

A mission for me out of blue. The order? Become a PhD student of certain proffesor. I expected more to be honest.

...

The mission accomplished. Professor Dwarfus so happy with me. After getting aquinted with the other studens, I'm can guess why I am qualified. None is taller than him. All are females and frankly, they are more like a harem.

...

Dwarfus managed to get me another well-paid job. Now I'm his  assistant in research. Why? It seems I'm the only one who can extract and evaluate data no matter how I suck at the task. The other students' function? Ornamental? Warming the bed? Whatever.

Thanks to that, I got the access to sources I've never seen before. I thought the University is subsided by Them, but this is not the case. Dwarfus finds my curiosity and cautiousness related to Them laughable. "DOZOR doesn't exist! This is only a superstition."

...

Good for Dwarfus. I'm reporting his research to the organization he thinks that doesn't exist. I like my assignment. Trying constantly to downplay what we have stumbled upon. Otherwise, my next goal would be to bury Dwarfus. The stuff is heavy. And he talks and writes too much. He is so proud about his name in the Brown's book. I guess Brown got out of Their hook just because his book is complete jibberish.

...

Huge discovery! It's too massive! I believe I calculated  position of one forgotten Space Station. Perhaps the main one with the gift. How to proceed? Should I report it?

...

It took days before Dwarfus understood the hidden hints I left in my presentation. Thankfully, he thinks he did it. That mindless moron kept bragging about his cleverness the whole afternoon. I had to cue him to stay silent. Otherwise, someone may steal "his achievement". Good grief! What a talkative puppet. He is off to borrow a ship from the University. Girls are thrilled. Another fieldtrip in Space. Hurray!

...

They seem to suspect something. I got very clear instructions. If the base belongs to Him, report findings and take care of the crew. They sent a bag full of explosives. My safe return? Probably useless to ask about it. We have to sacrifice for our Thing. Like I care.
