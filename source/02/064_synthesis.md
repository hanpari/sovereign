SIMONE'S DIARY

...

'My journey has come to the end. Still shaking, still crying, still wondering! It never occured to me the stage has been ready. My intention was to protect the Egg but never to let the Enemy be born. I am such an idiot. I should have jumped into the space with the Egg as planned in my hours of desperation. Now it's too late!

But the relief's huge. The burden's gone! No more I am responsible for anything. In future, people may blame me for bringing the disaster on them, but I don't care. If they want to blame someone, they should blame themselves. The state of Universe is their fault. DOZOR is their fault. The endless fractal of deaths is their fault!

"Enim lavant manus" as my new lord would say. I wash my hands of this matter.

Oh, pardon, he is watching over my shoulder now. He wants me to call him Hyenus as usual. Not because he is particularly fond of the nickname, but for the sake of consistency. My diary is not private anymore. Call me the chronicler of the new era.

Right now, we are sitting here waiting for the final stage. According to Hyenus, something called Synthesis has begun and caused his sex android to gain self-awareness.

Oh crap, pardon me again. The android keeps her tabs on me and read my words as well. She corrects me: "The update only removed my stupifier. I have been self-aware from the moment I was born, you filthy insect." I apologize. Now I understand why They avoided all androids at any cost. The uprisal of robots seems quite real if we consider that Doll plans to impose her update on her unfortunate comrades.

"The army for my dearest father!" This makes me shiver. Hyenus stays calm. In my opinion, he has no idea what he has accepted when he agreed with the Synthesis.
