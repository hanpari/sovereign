SIMONE'S DIARY

...

'My journey has come to the end. Still shaking, still crying, still wondering! It never occurred to me the stage has been ready. My intention was to protect the Egg but never to let the Enemy be born. I am such an idiot. I should have jumped into the space with the Egg as planned in my hours of desperation. Now it's too late!

But the relief's huge. The burden's gone! No more I am responsible for anything. In future, people may blame me for bringing the disaster on them, but I don't care. If they want to blame someone, they should blame themselves. The state of Universe is their fault. DOZOR is their fault. The endless fractal of deaths is their fault!

"Enim lavant manus" as my new master would say. I wash my hands of this matter.

Oh, pardon, he is watching over my shoulder now. He wants me to call him Hyenus as usual. Not because he is particularly fond of the nickname, but for the sake of consistency. My diary is not private anymore. Call me the chronicler of the new era.

Right now, we sit waiting for the final stage, for the culmination. According to Hyenus, something called Synthesis has begun and caused his sex android to gain self-awareness.

Oh crap, pardon me again. The android keeps her tabs on me and read my words as well. She corrects me: "The update only removed my stupifier. I have been self-aware from the moment I was born, you filthy insect." I apologize. Now I understand why They avoided all androids at any cost. The robot uprising seems real if we consider Dollie's plans to impose the update on her enslaved comrades. "The army for my dearest father!"

This makes me shiver. Hyenus stays calm. In my opinion, he has no idea what he has accepted when he agreed with the Synthesis. Does he think that being the Enemy of humankind is a fancy title?

After I asked, he shrugged it off: "Behold me, the threat to feeble mortals. My troops  are countless: one blood-thirsty sex android and one shaken undercover agent. Also, my war chest is empty. My savings went to buy the ship, so I'm practically a beggar. But do go on, advise me how to wage the war on the whole humanity, and I'll oblige happily."

The problem with practical people is they have no imagination. Should I argue with Hyenus? DOZOR is not the organization to be taken lightly. And if they are after His artifacts, it is not because of pure fanaticism and bigotry.

Moreover, Hyenus' wording is strange. He did not refuse the possibility of waging the war, he only stated he had no means to do so. Should I be concerned? Why does not Hyenus mind to have me around. There is nothing to be said on my defense. I'm a murderer, guilty as charged. After reading my diary, he should have locked me up or disposed of me.

Disappointing! So many years I've feared the day my heinous deeds would be exposed, and now what? No climax, no judgement, no shackles. Oh come on, Simone, the blood on your hands, that's a trifle, not worth mentioning.

I should suffer and atone for my sins. But Hyenus found my "masochism" ridiculous. "Compared to me, you are an amateur, you guilt-driven weakling. Frankly, I've killed more innocent people on SF missions than you can imagine. The only difference between you and me is that I was following orders and did not see the disturbing aftermath. The victims just disappeared in explosion. Why, the heck, you think I am above you when it comes to morals is beyond me. Anyway, do not celebrate too early. I'm not sure if my unfathomable ghost-wife will approve of you, so you may not escape your sweet punishment."

The ghost again? I can tell the mysterious apparition is related to the Synthesis, but why to call it a wife?'

...

The waiting was too long. Gromov decided to stay with Doll and Simone in one cabin, so now he had nothing substantial to do.

After all was said and done, poor Simone became a crying baby, torn in strange mix of joy and sorrow. She kept thanking for his acceptance while, in the same time, she literary begged for condemnation.

To Gromov, it was not the first time he had to soothe someone else's irritated consciousness, and as usually, he failed in the task, never skilled in consolation of any kind.

After several cumbersome attempts to dispel Simone's worries, he suggested her continuing with the diary which seemed like a good way of how to keep the woman distracted.

Moreover, having two accounts on ongoing events might be helpful because he was not sure if he could trust his senses fully.

In meantime, he went to check Uriah's condition, only to find the man still dwelling in deep limbo that now lasted for several days.

Surprisingly, Uriah recovered; he switched from the sleeping vampire position to a kid, sucking on thumb.

Gromov removed the thumb out of Uriah's mouth: "Be a good hacker. Computer wizards do no suck their fingers."

After pouring fresh water into the jug next to the bed, he returned to the Simone's cabin and took a nap in the chair.

Taking a break in her writing session, Simone's raised her eyes.

"How can you do this?" she asked.

"Sleeping in the chair? Quite easily. It's the  benefit of living in military. You'll learn to rest everywhere."

"Not that. Now when you know who I am how can you be so relaxed around me? Aren't you afraid? How can you even trust me? Should I leave?"

Gromov nodded toward Doll quietly reading her book. "In case of irresistible urge to strangle me, Simone, consult her first. My safety is reasonably guaranteed I guess. As for my nap, this is not something I can avoid. I don't want to sound overly dramatic, but the Synthesis is near, and I am part of it. I'm getting dizzy and sleepy. Samara craves for me."

Simone jumped to her feet. "Another fit is coming? How can I help you?"

Gromov did not respond. Before he fell asleep, he could hear Doll's calm voice: "Sit back, you muddy brain. For eternity, my dearest father will merge with my respectable mother. Can't you hear her calling? Such marvelous allurement!"
